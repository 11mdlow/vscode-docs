Welcome to the October release of VS Code. There are a number of significant updates in this version that we hope you will like, some of the key highlights include:

* **[Highlight 2](#highlight-2)** - Brief description of Highlight 2.

TBD Above list 10-12 release highlights with links to h3 headers

The release notes are arranged in the following sections related to VS Code focus areas. Here are some further updates:

* **[Workbench](#workbench)** - Other updates in Workbench section.
* **[Editor](#editor)** - Other updates in Editor section.
* **[Languages](#languages)** - Other updates in Languages section.
* **[Extensions](#extensions)** - Other updates in Extension section.

* **[Extension Authoring](#extension-authoring)** - Other updates in Extension Authoring section.

## Workbench

### Horizontal layout

You can now change the layout of editor groups to be either vertical or horizontal. Both layouts behave the same as before allowing you to move and resize editors and editor groups.

![Horizontal](images/1_7/horizontal.png)

To enable horizontal layout, set the new `workbench.editor.sideBySideLayout` setting to `horizontal`. 

There are more places where you can quickly enable this layout:

* The **View** menu **Horizonatal/Vertical Editor Layout**.
* The Command Palette **Toggle Vertical/Horizontal Layout**
* An action in the header of the **OPEN EDITORS** view

There is also a keybinding (`kb(workbench.action.toggleEditorLayout)`) to quickly switch between the two layouts.

### Some view related settings moved to the user settings file

We changed some of the toggles in the View menu to update your user settings file instead of persisting their state in the browser. This will make it easier to restore the same state on a different machine by copying the settings file.

The following settings will now be changed in your user settings file when you change them from the View menu:

* `workbench.sideBar.location` to control the position of the Sidebar (left or right)
* `workbench.statusBar.visible` to control the visibility of the Status Bar

In addition, changing the Zoom level from the View menu now writes to `window.zoomLevel`.

### Open multiple files from Quick Open

Thanks to [Will Prater (@wprater)](https://github.com/wprater), you can now open multiple files from Quick Open by just pressing the Right arrow key. This will open the currently selected file in the background and you can continue selecting files from Quick Open.

### Update 2

## Extension Authoring

### Provide menu entries for the editor tab context menu

We added an additional place where extensions can contribute menu entries, the context menu of an editor tab (this also works when tabs are disabled). The related menu path for contributing here is `editor/title/context`.

For example:

```json
"commands": [{
    "command": "doSomething",
    "title": "Do Something"
}],
"menus": {
    "editor/title/context": [
        {
            "command": "doSomething"
        }
    ]
}
```
