## Workbench

### Horizontal layout

You can now change the layout of editors between vertical arrangement and horizontal. Both layouts behave the same as before with the typical features of moving editor groups or editors around and resizing them. 

![Horizontal](images/1_7/horizontal.png)

To enable horizontal layout, you can set the new `workbench.editor.sideBySideLayout` setting to `horizontal`. There are more places where you can quickly enable this layout:
* from the View menu
* from the command palette
* from an action in the header of the "Opened Editors" view

We also introduced a keybinding (`kb(workbench.action.toggleEditorLayout)`).

### Some view related settings moved to the user settings file

We revisited some of the toggles in the View menu to actually update your user settings file instead of persisting this in the browser. This will make it easier to restore the same state on a different machine by copying the settings file. 
These settings will from now on be changed in your user settings file when you change them from the View menu:
* `workbench.sideBar.location` to control the position of the sidebar (left or right)
* `workbench.statusBar.visible` to control the visibility of the status bar

In addition, changing the window zoom level from the View menu now writes to `window.zoomLevel`.

### Open multiple files from quick open

Thanks to [Will Prater (@wprater)](https://github.com/wprater) you can now open multiple files from quick open by just pressing the arrow-right key. This will open the currently selected file in the background and you can continue selecting files from quick open.

## Extension Authoring

### Provide menu entries for the editor tab context menu
We added an additional place where extensions can contribute menu entries to: The context menu of an editor tab (this also works when tabs are disabled). The related menu path for contributing here is `editor/title/context`.

For example:

```json
"commands": [{
    "command": "doSomething",
    "title": "Do Something"
}],
"menus": {
    "editor/title/context": [
        {
            "command": "doSomething"
        }
    ]
}
```
