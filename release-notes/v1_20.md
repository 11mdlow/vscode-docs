# January 2018 (version 1.20)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.20 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/41061)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/58?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the December/January milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Save files that need admin privileges

It is now possible to save files that require administrator privileges. One example is making changes to `/etc/hosts`. If the file exists on disk and requires elevated permissions, a new action **Retry as Admin...** will show up on an error message:

![Save as Admin](images/1_20/save_admin.gif)

Saving as admin is supported on all platforms. Depending on the platform, the prompt to authenticate as administrator will look differently.

### OPEN EDITORS Updates

* Thanks to @ironyman, the **OPEN EDITORS** view can now be resized once it reaches the maximum size specified by `explorer.openEditors.visible`. Due to this change, the setting `explorer.openEditors.dynamicHeight` is no longer supported.
* The ability to set `explorer.openEditors.visible` to 0 to hide the **OPEN EDITORS** view is being deprecated in the January release and we plan to drop it in February. To hide the **OPEN EDITORS** view, use the context menu in the Explorer title area to control the visibility of views.

### More themable colors for editor tabs

With this release, new themable colors are added for editor tabs:

* `tab.hoverBackground`: Tab background color when hovering
* `tab.unfocusedHoverBackground`: Tab background color in an unfocused group when hovering
* `tab.hoverBorder`: Border to highlight tabs when hovering
* `tab.unfocusedHoverBorder`: Border to highlight tabs in an unfocused group when hovering

![Tab Colors](images/1_20/tab_hover.gif)

You can configure these colors also from the `workbench.colorCustomizations` setting.

### Custom drop-down (Windows, Linux)

On Windows and Linux, drop-downs now use a custom widget instead of the HTML control. The drop-down leverages the same colors as the tree/list widget in other parts:

This fixes a couple of issues where the HTML drop-down was not showing up properly in some cases.

### Disable macOS Touch Bar entries

A new setting `keyboard.touchbar.enabled` disables the macOS Touch Bar entries that VS Code is providing.

## Languages

### TypeScript 2.7.1
VS Code now ships with TypeScript 2.7.1. This update brings a number of new features and bug fixes.

### Extension Contributed TypeScript Plugins
[TypeScript plugins](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Writing-a-Language-Service-Plugin) let developers extend VS Code's JavaScript and TypeScript language support. For example, a plugin might add additional linting to a file or perhaps add IntelliSense for working within JavaScript template strings.

TypeScript plugins were first introduced in TypeScript 2.3, but they previously required installing plugins into your workspace with `npm` and then configuring a `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` to load them. VS Code 1.20 simplifies this by allowing extensions to contribute a set of global TypeScript plugins that are automatically activated without any configuration. All you need to do is install the extension.

A few extensions are already making use of this:

* [styled-coponents](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components) — Syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and error reporting for styled-component css strings.
* [lit-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html) — Syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and formatting for lit-html template strings.

Extension contributed plugins are automatically activated for VS Code's version of TypeScript. If you are using a workspace version of TypeScript you must still install the TypeScript plugins in your workspace.

Our extension authoring docs have more information about the new [TypeScript Plugin contribution point](/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points.md#contributestypescriptserverplugins). We're very excited to see how extenion authors leverage this!


## Extension Authoring

### New menu group identifiers

Several menus now have new group identifiers for finer control on command placement:

**Editor Tab Context Menu**

* `1_close`: Commands related to closing editors
* `3_preview`: Commands related to pinning editors

**Editor Title Menu**

* `1_diff`: Commands related to working with diff editors
* `3_open`: Commands related to opening editors
* `5_close`: Commands related to closing editors

## New commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.moveEditorToFirstGroup)`|Move Editor into First Group|`workbench.action.moveEditorToFirstGroup`
`kb(workbench.action.moveEditorToSecondGroup)`|Move Editor into Second Group|`workbench.action.moveEditorToSecondGroup`
`kb(workbench.action.moveEditorToThirdGroup)`|Move Editor into Third Group|`workbench.action.moveEditorToThirdGroup`

Command `workbench.action.files.revealActiveFileInWindows` is a duplication of an already available command `revealFileInOS`. Therefore we are deprecating the `workbench.action.files.revealActiveFileInWindows` command in the January release and plan to drop it in February.

Command `workbench.action.files.copyPathOfActiveFile` is a duplication of an already available command `copyFilePath`. Therefore we are deprecating the `workbench.action.files.copyPathOfActiveFile` command in the January release and plan to drop it in February.
