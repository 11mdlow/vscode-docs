# January 2018 (version 1.20)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.20 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/41061)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/58?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the December/January milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Multi-Select in the Explorer and OPEN EDITORS view

You can now select multiple files in the Explorer and **OPEN EDITORS** view to run actions on multiple items.

![Multi Select](images/1_20/multi-select.gif)

As a consequence, clicking with the `Ctrl/Cmd` key pressed will no longer open an editor to the side because this key is now used to add more items to the multi-selection. A new setting `workbench.multiSelectModifier` allow you to change back to the old behavior by setting it to `"workbench.multiSelectModifier": "alt"`. With this setting, you use the `Alt` key to add items to the selection.

### Save files that need admin privileges

It is now possible to save files that require administrator privileges. One example is making changes to `/etc/hosts`. If the file exists on disk and requires elevated permissions, a new action **Retry as Admin...** will show up on an error message:

![Save as Admin](images/1_20/save_admin.gif)

Saving as admin is supported on all platforms. Depending on the platform, the prompt to authenticate as administrator will look differently.

### OPEN EDITORS updates

* Thanks to [@ironyman](https://github.com/ironyman), the **OPEN EDITORS** view can now be resized once it reaches the maximum size specified by `explorer.openEditors.visible`. Due to this change, the setting `explorer.openEditors.dynamicHeight` is no longer supported.
* The ability to set `explorer.openEditors.visible` to 0 to hide the **OPEN EDITORS** view is being deprecated in the January release and we plan to drop it in February. To hide the **OPEN EDITORS** view, use the context menu in the Explorer title area to control the visibility of views.

### More themable colors for editor tabs

With this release, new themable colors are added for editor tabs:

* `tab.hoverBackground`: Tab background color when hovering
* `tab.unfocusedHoverBackground`: Tab background color in an unfocused group when hovering
* `tab.hoverBorder`: Border to highlight tabs when hovering
* `tab.unfocusedHoverBorder`: Border to highlight tabs in an unfocused group when hovering

![Tab Colors](images/1_20/tab_hover.gif)

You can configure these colors also from the `workbench.colorCustomizations` setting.

### Custom drop-down (Windows, Linux)

On Windows and Linux, drop-downs now use a custom widget instead of the HTML control. The drop-down leverages the same colors as the tree/list widget in other parts:

![Custom Drop-down](images/1_20/dropdown.png)

This fixes a couple of issues where the HTML drop-down was not showing up properly in some cases.

### Disable macOS Touch Bar entries

A new setting `keyboard.touchbar.enabled` disables the macOS Touch Bar entries that VS Code is providing.

### New workbench.fontAliasing setting

You can now set `"workbench.fontAliasing": "auto"` to control font aliasing depending on the DPI of the monitor that VS Code is showing on. If set to `auto`, VS Code will apply `default` or `antialiased` automatically based on the DPI of the display.

## Editor

### Save Large Files >256 MB

It is now possible to save files >256 MB where previously an error was reported. This was achieved by changing the implementation of how VS Code stores the contents of the editor to disk. Instead of loading the entire file contents into memory, we leverage a snapshot of the content and stream it into the file in chunks of 64KB.

## Languages

### TypeScript 2.7.1

VS Code now ships with TypeScript 2.7.1. This update brings a number of new features and bug fixes.

### Bracket property suggestions

Spaces got you down? When you type `.`, VS Code now shows all known properties for JavaScript and TypeScript, even if a property name contain whitespaces or other non-identifier characters.

![]()

Accepting one of these suggestions automatically converts to bracket accessor notation.

![]()

### Automatic member property suggestions

Tired of typing `this.` to access class properties in JavaScript and TypeScript? Now you can just start typing to see available members.

![]()

Accept a member property suggestion, and VS Code automatically inserts the require `this.`.

![]()

### Recommended suggestions

### Marking of optional property in suggestions

Suggestions for optional TypeScript properties are now suffixed with a `?`:

![Optional property suggestions](images/1_20/ts-optional-prop-completions.png)

JavaScript users will also see `?` for completions that come from `*.d.ts` Type Declaration (typings) packages.

### Quick Fix all for JavaScript and TypeScript

Fix errors in a flash with new Quick Fix all for JavaScript and TypeScript. Move your cursor to a fixable error such as an unused variable, and trigger Quick Fixes using the lightbulb or by pressing `kb(editor.action.quickFix)`. If one of the available Quick Fixes can be applied to multiple errors in the current file, you'll see a new **Fix all in file** code action.

![Quick fix all in file](images/1_20/ts-fix-all-in-file-pre.png)

Accept and all errors will disappear:

![Quick fix all fixes all similar errors in the current file](images/1_20/ts-fix-all-in-file-post.png)

### Extension contributed TypeScript plugins

[TypeScript plugins](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Writing-a-Language-Service-Plugin) let developers extend VS Code's JavaScript and TypeScript language support. For example, a TypeScript plugin might add additional linting to a file or add IntelliSense when working within JavaScript template strings.

TypeScript plugins were first introduced in TypeScript 2.3, but they previously required installing plugins into your workspace with `npm` and then configuring a `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file to load them. VS Code 1.20 simplifies this by allowing extensions to contribute a set of global TypeScript plugins that are automatically activated without any configuration. All you need to do is install the extension.

A few extensions are already making use of this:

* [vscode-styled-components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components) â€”Â Syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and error reporting for [styled-component](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) CSS strings.
* [lit-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html) â€” Syntax highlighting,Â IntelliSense, and formatting for [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html) template strings.

Extension contributed plugins are automatically activated for VS Code's version of TypeScript. If you are using a workspace version of TypeScript, you must still install the TypeScript plugins in your workspace.

Our extension authoring documentation has more information about the new [TypeScript Plugin contribution point](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributestypescriptserverplugins). We're very excited to see how extension authors leverage this!

## Extension Authoring

### New menu group identifiers

Several menus now have new group identifiers for finer control on command placement:

**Editor Tab context menu**

* `1_close`: Commands related to closing editors
* `3_preview`: Commands related to pinning editors

**Editor Title menu**

* `1_diff`: Commands related to working with diff editors
* `3_open`: Commands related to opening editors
* `5_close`: Commands related to closing editors

### CodeActionProvider improvements

A `CodeActionProvider` can now return objects of the new `CodeAction` class. `CodeAction` adds additional metadata and functionality over `Command`, and better captures what code actions are and how they are used in VS Code's UI.

A `CodeAction` primarily consists of a `title`, `kind`, and at least a `Command` or (new in VS Code 1.20) a `WorkspaceEdit`.

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode'

/**
 * Quick fix provider that converts :) to ðŸ˜€
 */
export class Emojizer implements vscode.CodeActionProvider {
    provideCodeActions(document: vscode.TextDocument, range: vscode.Range) {
        const pos = range.start;
        const line = document.lineAt(pos.line);

        // Check if we are at a :)
        if (line.text[pos.character] === ':' && line.text[pos.character + 1] === ')') {
            const fix = new vscode.CodeAction('Convert to ðŸ˜€', vscode.CodeActionKind.QuickFix);
            fix.edit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();
            fix.edit.replace(document.uri, new vscode.Range(pos, pos.translate(0, 2)), 'ðŸ˜€');
            return fix;
        }
        return undefined;
    }
}
```

`CodeAction` also adds metadata about code actions, including the code action's kind (`vscode.CodeActionKind.QuickFix` in the example above) and the set of diagnostics that the code action addresses. We use this metadata to implement features such as the `Refactor` command and `vscode.action.codeAction` keybindings, and plan to build additional features using it in the future.

### New command to remove a file from "Recently Opened"

A new command `vscode.removeFromRecentlyOpened` removes entries from the **Open Recent** list in the File menu.

## New commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(editor.action.refactor)`|Open refactoring context menu at current position|`workbench.action.refactor`
`kb(workbench.action.moveEditorToFirstGroup)`|Move Editor into First Group|`workbench.action.moveEditorToFirstGroup`
`kb(workbench.action.moveEditorToSecondGroup)`|Move Editor into Second Group|`workbench.action.moveEditorToSecondGroup`
`kb(workbench.action.moveEditorToThirdGroup)`|Move Editor into Third Group|`workbench.action.moveEditorToThirdGroup`
`kb(list.expandSelectionDown)`|Multi-Select in lists/trees: expand selection down|`list.expandSelectionDown`
`kb(list.expandSelectionUp)`|Multi-Select in lists/trees: expand selection up|`list.expandSelectionUp`

Command `workbench.action.files.revealActiveFileInWindows` is a duplication of an already available command `revealFileInOS`. Therefore we are deprecating the `workbench.action.files.revealActiveFileInWindows` command in the January release and plan to drop it in February.

Command `workbench.action.files.copyPathOfActiveFile` is a duplication of an already available command `copyFilePath`. Therefore we are deprecating the `workbench.action.files.copyPathOfActiveFile` command in the January release and plan to drop it in February.
