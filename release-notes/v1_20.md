# January 2018 (version 1.20)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.20 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/41061)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/58?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the December/January milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Multi-Select in the Explorer and OPEN EDITORS view

You can now select multiple files in the **EXPLORER** and **OPEN EDITORS** view to run actions on multiple items.

![Multi Select](images/1_20/multi-select.gif)

As a consequence, clicking with the `Ctrl/Cmd` key pressed will no longer open an editor to the side because this key is now used to add more items to the multi-selection. A new setting `workbench.list.multiSelectModifier` allow you to change back to the old behavior by setting it to `"workbench.list.multiSelectModifier": "alt"`. With this setting, you use the `Alt` key to add items to the selection.

### Error indicators in the Explorer

We now decorate files with errors or warnings in the explorer.

![Error Decorations](images/1_20/error-decoration.png)

The setting `problems.decorations.enabled` allows you to enable/disable the error/warning decorations.

### Settings search

VS Code provides a ton of settings, and it can be hard to find the setting you're looking for when you don't know which terms to use. We have improved the search functionality in the Settings editor to go beyond a simple filtering with literal word matches. It will now search with an awareness of alternate wordings, typos, stemmings ("saving" -> "save") and should provide a G̶o̶o̶g̶l̶e̶ Bing-like search experience.

![Settings search](images/1_20/settings-search.png)

If you prefer the old style of search, you can disable this feature with `"workbench.settings.enableNaturalLanguageSearch": false`.

### "Smart Case" search

You can now set `"search.smartCase": true` to enable "smart case" mode for search. When enabled, VS Code will automatically do a case-sensitive search when you search for a query that contains an uppercase character. If your search query is all lowercase, then the search will be case-insensitive.

For example, searching "code" will match "code" or "Code". Searching "Code" will only match "Code".

### Save files that need admin privileges

It is now possible to save files that require administrator privileges. One example is making changes to `/etc/hosts`. If the file exists on disk and requires elevated permissions, a new action **Retry as Admin...** will show up on an error message. Saving as admin is supported on all platforms. Depending on the platform, the prompt to authenticate as administrator will look differently.

### Save large files >256 MB

It is now possible to save files >256 MB where previously an error was reported. This was achieved by changing the implementation of how VS Code stores the contents of the editor to disk. Instead of loading the entire file contents into memory, we leverage a snapshot of the content and stream it into the file in chunks of 64KB.

### OPEN EDITORS updates

* Thanks to [@ironyman](https://github.com/ironyman), the **OPEN EDITORS** view can now be resized once it reaches the maximum size specified by `explorer.openEditors.visible`. Due to this change, the setting `explorer.openEditors.dynamicHeight` is no longer supported.
* The ability to set `explorer.openEditors.visible` to 0 to hide the **OPEN EDITORS** view is being deprecated in the January release and we plan to drop it in February. To hide the **OPEN EDITORS** view, use the context menu in the Explorer title area to control the visibility of views.

### Double-click to open in list/tree

A new setting, `workbench.list.openMode`, was added that controls if items in trees and lists should open on single or double mouse-click. This setting applies both to opening items as well as expanding/collapsing items if they have children.

**Note:** The setting is supported for most trees/lists in VS Code, but in some case we left the default behavior when we thought single-click still makes the most sense. We are happy to hear your feedback!

### More themable colors for editor tabs

With this release, new themable colors are added for editor tabs:

* `tab.hoverBackground`: Tab background color when hovering
* `tab.unfocusedHoverBackground`: Tab background color in an unfocused group when hovering
* `tab.hoverBorder`: Border to highlight tabs when hovering
* `tab.unfocusedHoverBorder`: Border to highlight tabs in an unfocused group when hovering

You can configure these colors also from the `workbench.colorCustomizations` setting.

### Custom drop-down (Windows, Linux)

On Windows and Linux, drop-downs now use a custom widget instead of the HTML control. The drop-down leverages the same colors as the tree/list widget in other parts:

![Custom Drop-down](images/1_20/dropdown.png)

This fixes a couple of issues where the HTML drop-down was not showing up properly in some cases.

### Disable macOS Touch Bar entries

A new setting `keyboard.touchbar.enabled` disables the macOS Touch Bar entries that VS Code is providing.

### workbench.fontAliasing setting

You can now set `"workbench.fontAliasing": "auto"` on macOS to control font aliasing depending on the DPI of the monitor that VS Code is showing on. If set to `auto`, VS Code will apply `default` or `antialiased` automatically based on the DPI of the display.

### Language packs

We added support for language packs which will allow adding additional translations to VS Code using an extension. The screen shot below shows VS Code running using a Bulgarian language pack generated from VS Code's [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/microsoft-oss/) project:

![Language Pack](images/1_20/language-pack.png)

In the next months we will work with the translators in Transfix to establish a process on how to best publish their translations as language pack extensions in the [market place](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)

### Variables can be scoped to workspace folders

We've introduced a new variable syntax to scope variables to a specific workspace folder. By appending the root folder's name to a variable (separated by a colon), it is possible to reach into sibling root folders of a workspace. Without the root folder name the variable is scoped to the same folder where it is used.

For example, in a multi root workspace with folders `Server` and `Client`, a `${workspaceFolder:Client}` refers to the path of the `Client` root. For a more involved example see section [Improved debugging support for Multi Root Workspaces](#improved-debugging-support-for-multi-root-workspaces).

> More about variable substitution can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference)

### Output panel

Now you can see VS Code logs with syntax highlighting in Output panel.

![Log channels](images/1_20/output-log-channels.png)

The Output panel also now consumes less memory resources with our new implementation. Memory resources of an output channel are released when not shown.

### UX designs for notifications

During this milestone, the UX (User Experience) team worked on redesigning the notifications display in VS Code. We plan to start development work on these designs in the February milestone. More details about the design can be found in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22388#issuecomment-361915332) and we are happy for your feedback.

### Image preview zooming

A PR from [Brian Schlenker (@bschlenk)](https://github.com/bschlenk) adding zooming for image preview:

![Zooming a preview](images/1_20/image-zoom.png)

Zoom in and out by clicking, using the scrollwheel, or pinching on a track pad. The current zoom level is shown in the Status Bar. Click on the zoom Status Bar item to quickly switch zoom levels or reset the view.

## Editor

### Keybindings for Quick Fixes and Code Actions

The new `editor.action.codeAction` command lets you configure keybindings for specific Code Actions. This keybinding for example triggers the Extract function refactoring Code Actions:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+r ctrl+e",
  "command": "editor.action.codeAction",
  "args": {
    "kind": "refactor.extract.function"
  }
}
```

Code Action kinds are specified by extensions using the enhanced `CodeActionProvided` API. Kinds are hierarchical, so `"kind": "refactor"` will show all refactoring Code Actions, whereas `"kind": "refactor.extract.function"` will only show Extract function refactorings.

Using the above keybinding, if only a single `"refactor.extract.function"` Code Action is available, it will be automatically applied. If multiple Extract function Code Actions are available, we bring up a context menu to select them:

![Select Code Action context menu](images/1_20/code-action-context-menu.png)

You can also control how/when Code Actions are automatically applied using the `apply` argument:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+r ctrl+e",
  "command": "editor.action.codeAction",
  "args": {
    "kind": "refactor.extract.function",
    "apply": "first"
  }
}
```

Valid values for `"apply"`:

* `"first"` - Always automatically apply the first available Code Action.
* `"ifSingle"` - Default. Automatically apply the Code Action if only one is available. Otherwise, show the context menu.
* `"never"` — Always show the Code Action context menu, even if only a single Code Action is available.

### Global snippets

VS Code now supports global snippets meaning snippets that aren't scoped to a single language but can target any kind of files. Using the  **Preferences: Configure User Snippets** command, select the **New Global Snippets file...** option which will open a `.code-snippets` file for new snippets.  Use the `scope` attribute to list the languages that are targeted by a snippet. For instance, the snippet below can add a copyright header for JavaScript and TypeScript files:

```json
"JS & TS Stub": {
  "scope": "javascript,typescript",
  "prefix": "stub",
  "body": [
    "/*--------------------------------------------------------------",
    " *  Copyright (c) Your Corporation. All rights reserved.",
    " *  Licensed under the MIT License.",
    " *-------------------------------------------------------------*/",
    "",
    "'use strict';",
    "",
    "$0"
  ],
  "description": "Insert Copyright Statement"
}
```

Extension authors can also contribute global snippets. Include a `code-snippets` file in your extension and omit the language property in the `contributes.snippets` section of your `package.json`.

### More snippet variables

We have added new snippet variables to read your clipboard, `CLIPBOARD`, and to insert the current date and time. For date and time,
 combine any of these variables:

* `CURRENT_YEAR`
* `CURRENT_YEAR_SHORT`
* `CURRENT_MONTH`
* `CURRENT_DATE`
* `CURRENT_HOUR`
* `CURRENT_MINUTE`
* `CURRENT_SECOND`

### Suggestion improvements

We have refined how suggestions are prioritized and we have added a new setting, `editor.suggestSelection`, to control how suggestions are selected in the UI. You can make sure the top item is always selected (`first`), you can make it select the previously used item (`recentlyUsed`), or you can selected items based on prefixes you have used (`recentlyUsedByPrefix`). A more complete explanation with screenshots is in this GitHub [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/41060#issuecomment-360529596).

### Emmet improvements

You can now prefix your CSS abbreviations with `-` to get all applicable vendor prefixes included in the expanded abbreviation.

![Vendor prefix in Emmet](images/1_20/emmetprefix.gif)

Read more on [how to control vendor prefix in Emmet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet#_include-vendor-prefixes).

Other notable bug fixes in Emmet:

* Use of `@-` to get numbering in descending order in repeaters not working. [Bug #35296](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35296)
* The `snippets.json` file for custom Emmet snippets fails to get parsed in the presence of comments. [Bug #33818](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33818)
* When using `bem` style, part of class names that appear after `-` get cut. [Bug #38768](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/38768)
* `Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation` command should wrap the entire HTML element when cursor is in either open or close tag. [Bug #41516](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/41516)
* `Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation` command should support `|c` and `|bem` filters. [Bug #40471](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/40471)
* `Emmet: Update Tag` and `Emmet: Remove Tag` commands matches wrong pair in the presence of self closing tags. [Bug #39789](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/39789)
* `Emmet: Expand Abbreviation` command doesn't expand abbreviation that contains unescaped single quotes. [Bug #38807](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/38807)
* Emmet expansion gets triggered when editing the value of a CSS property, [Bug #34162](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34162)

### Control cursor width

Use the new setting `editor.cursorWidth` to control the width of the cursor in pixels. This is only applicable when the `editor.cursorStyle` is set to `line`.

![Control cursor width](images/1_20/cursor-width.gif)

### Global macOS find clipboard

macOS has a global find clipboard that allows applications to share text for searching. It's already supported by many macOS apps like Chrome, TextEdit, and Sublime Text, and is now enabled by default in the editor Find widget. When you search for text in another app, you will notice that text is automatically populated in the Find widget.

You can use the `"editor.find.globalFindClipboard"` setting to disable it in the editor. It's also supported by the Search view, disabled by default, and can be enabled with the `"search.globalFindClipboard"` setting.

## Debugging

### Improved debugging support for Multi-root Workspaces

A multi root workspace can be used to work on related projects (e.g. "Server" and "Client") in a single workspace.
Each of these folders have their own launch configurations (e.g. "Launch Server" and "Launch Client") but until now it was not possible to combine launch configurations from different folders into a "compound" launch configuration (because there was no mechanism to reference launch configurations across folders).

In this milestone we have addressed this limitation: first we've added support for "workspace" scoped launch configurations, and second we've introduced a syntax for referencing launch configurations across folders.
With this compound launch configs that reach into different folders can be kept where they belong: at the workspace level.

Workspace scoped launch configurations live in the `"launch"` section of the workspace configuration file which can be easily edited via VS Code's Settings editor:

![Workspace Settings](images/1_20/workspace-settings.png)

Alternatively new launch configurations can be added via the "Add Config (workspace)" entry of the Launch Configuration drop-down menu:

![Log channels](images/1_20/add-config.png)

A compound launch configuration can reference the individual launch configurations by name as long as the names are unique within the workspace, e.g. like this:

```json
  "compounds": [{
      "name": "Launch Server & Client",
      "configurations": [
        "Launch Server",
        "Launch Client"
      ]
  }]
```

If the individual launch configuration names are not unique, the qualifying folder can be specified with a more verbose "folder" syntax:

```json
  "compounds": [{
      "name": "Launch Server & Client",
      "configurations": [
        "Launch Server",
        {
          "folder": "Web Client",
          "name": "Launch Client"
        },
        {
          "folder": "Desktop Client",
          "name": "Launch Client"
        }
      ]
  }]
```

In addition to `compounds` the `launch` section of the workspace configuration file can contain regular launch configurations too. Just make sure that all variables are explicitly scoped to a specific folder because otherwise they are not valid for the workspace. You can find more details about explicitly scoped variables in the section [above](#variables-can-be-scoped-to-workspace-folders).

Here is an example for a launch configuration where the program lives in a folder "Program" and where all files from a folder "Library" should be skipped when stepping:

```json
"launch": {
  "configurations": [{
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch test",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder:Program}/test.js",
      "skipFiles": [
        "${workspaceFolder:Library}/out/**/*.js"
      ]
  }]
}
```

### Node debugging

**Automatically attach debugger to Node.js subprocesses**

For node-debug we've added a mechanism that tracks all subprocesses of a debuggee and tries to automatically attach to those processes that are launched in debug mode. This feature simplifies debugging of programs that fork or spawn Node.js processes like programs based on the "cluster" node module.

The feature is enabled by setting the launch config attribute `autoAttachChildProcesses` to true:

```json
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Cluster",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/cluster.js",
  "autoAttachChildProcesses": true
}
```

**Please note:** In order to be able to track the subprocesses, we need the process ID of the parent. For this we require that the main debuggee launched from the launch config is a Node.js process and we use an "evaluate" to find its process ID.

Whether a process is in debug mode is guessed by analyzing the program arguments. Currently we detect the patterns `--inspect`, `--inspect-brk`, `--inspect-port`, `--debug`, `--debug-brk`, `--debug-port` (all optionally followed by a `=` and a port number).

**"nvm" support**

If you are using "nvm" (or "nvm-windows") to manage your Node.js versions it is now possible to specify a `runtimeVersion` attribute in a launch configuration for selecting a specific version of Node.js.

Here is an example launch config:

```json
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Launch test",
  "runtimeVersion": "7.10.1",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/test.js"
}
```

**Please note**: Make sure to have those Node.js versions installed that you want to use with the `runtimeVersion` attribute as the feature will not download and install the version itself. So you will have to run something like `nvm install 7.10.1` from the integrated terminal if you plan to add `runtimeVersion": "7.10.1"` to your launch configuration.

## Extensions

### Extension recommendations

When you are working on file types not supported out-of-the-box by VS Code or by any installed extension, you may not see syntax highlighting. If there are extensions in the Marketplace that can support such files, you will now be notified.

![Extension Recommendations for unknown file types](images/1_20/filerec.gif)

The extension recommendation list will now include extensions that are popular among other users who work on the same repository as you.

![Extension Recommendation based on whats popular among others on the same repo](images/1_20/popular-extension.png)

## Languages

### TypeScript 2.7.1

VS Code now ships with [TypeScript 2.7.1](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2018/01/31/announcing-typescript-2-7/). This update brings a number of new features and bug fixes.

### Quick Fix all for JavaScript and TypeScript

Fix errors in a flash with new Quick Fix all for JavaScript and TypeScript. Move your cursor to a fixable error such as an unused variable, and trigger Quick Fixes using the lightbulb or by pressing `kb(editor.action.quickFix)`. If one of the available Quick Fixes can be applied to multiple errors in the current file, you'll see a new **Fix all in file** Code Action.

![Quick fix all in file](images/1_20/ts-fix-all-in-file-pre.png)

Accept and all errors will disappear:

![Quick fix all fixes all similar errors in the current file](images/1_20/ts-fix-all-in-file-post.png)

### Extension contributed TypeScript plugins

[TypeScript plugins](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Writing-a-Language-Service-Plugin) let developers extend VS Code's JavaScript and TypeScript language support. For example, a TypeScript plugin might add additional linting to a file or add IntelliSense when working within JavaScript template strings.

![Styled component IntelliSense from the typescript-styled plugin](images/1_20/ts-styled-plugin.png)

TypeScript plugins were first introduced in TypeScript 2.3, but they previously required installing plugins into your workspace with `npm` and then configuring a `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file to load them. VS Code 1.20 simplifies this by allowing extensions to contribute a set of global TypeScript plugins that are automatically activated without any configuration. All you need to do is install the extension.

A few extensions are already making use of this:

* [vscode-styled-components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components) — Syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and error reporting for [styled-component](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) CSS strings.
* [lit-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html) — Syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and formatting for [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html) template strings.

Extension contributed plugins are automatically activated for VS Code's version of TypeScript. If you are using a workspace version of TypeScript, you must still install the TypeScript plugins in your workspace.

Our extension authoring documentation has more information about the new [TypeScript Plugin contribution point](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributestypescriptserverplugins). We're very excited to see how extension authors leverage this!

### Bracket property suggestions

Spaces got you down? When you type `.`, VS Code now shows all known properties for JavaScript and TypeScript, even if a property name contain whitespaces or other non-identifier characters.

![Suggestions for properties with spaces or other special characters are now shown](images/1_20/ts-bracket-pre.png)

Accepting one of these suggestions automatically converts to bracket accessor notation.

![Bracket accessor automatically inserted](images/1_20/ts-bracket-post.png)

### Automatic member property suggestions

Tired of typing `this.` to access class properties in JavaScript and TypeScript? Now you can just start typing to see available members.

![No more need to type this. to see property suggestions](images/1_20/ts-this-dot-pre.png)

Accept a member property suggestion, and VS Code automatically inserts the require `this.`.

![this. is automatically inserted when you suggest a property suggestion](images/1_20/ts-this-dot-post.png)

### Marking of optional property in suggestions

Suggestions for optional TypeScript properties are now suffixed with a `?`:

![Optional property suggestions](images/1_20/ts-optional-prop-completions.png)

JavaScript users will also see `?` for completions that come from `*.d.ts` Type Declaration (typings) packages.

### Auto-imports based on filename

Auto-imports for JavaScript and TypeScript now support importing default exported objects based on filename:

![importing a default exported object by filename](images/1_20/ts-auto-import-default.gif)

## Serviceability

Reporting an issue through the `Help` menu or the workbench `Report Issue` and `Report Performance Issue` commands now opens a separate window.

![The issue reporter](images/1_20/issue_reporter.png)

This window can collect information based on the type of issue you want to report. This inclues basic information about your system, your running extensions, what VSCode processes are running, and what types of files are in your workspace. You choose what to send and the reporter will open a browser window to preview the issue on GitHub.


## Extension Authoring

### Add, remove and change workspace folders

A new proposed API was added to change workspace folders in the currently opened workspace:

```typescript
updateWorkspaceFolders(
  start: number,
  deleteCount: number,
  ...workspaceFoldersToAdd: { uri: Uri, name?: string }[]
): boolean
```

This method can:

* Remove existing workspace folders (by providing the index of the folder to delete via `start` and the number of folders to remove via `deleteCount`).
* Add new workspace folders to a specific index (by providing the index where to add to via `start`, leaving `deleteCount` as `0` and providing the workspace folders to add as arguments).
* Update existing folders, for example, move them or rename them (by removing existing folders first and then adding them back again).

We plan to add this API to stable in a future milestone once we are confident enough with it. We welcome any feedback on how it works for your extension.

### Custom views

Custom views will become better and better with following additions to the API:

**Inline actions**

Extension authors can now contribute inline actions to tree items using `inline` group in `view/item/context` menu contribution. For example:

```json
"contributes": {
  "commands": [
    {
      "command": "jsonOutline.refreshNode",
      "title": "Refresh",
      "icon": {
        "light": "resources/light/refresh.svg",
        "dark": "resources/dark/refresh.svg"
      }
    }
  ],
  "menus": {
    "view/item/context": [
      {
        "command": "jsonOutline.refreshNode",
        "when": "view == jsonOutline",
        "group": "inline"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

![Inline actions](images/1_20/custom-view-inline-action.png)

**Resource URI**

If the custom tree view is based on file resources, then extension authors can provide the resource URI in the `TreeItem` representing it. This will adopt your view to the user configured File Icon theme and make it look similar to the File Explorer view in the Explorer.

```typescript
/**
 * The [uri](#Uri) of the resource representing this item.
 *
 * Will be used to derive the [label](#TreeItem.label), when it is not provided.
 * Will be used to derive the icon from current file icon theme, when [iconPath](#TreeItem.iconPath) is not provided.
 */
resourceUri?: Uri;
```

![Custom file view](images/1_20/custom-file-view.png)

**Id property**

Extension authors can provide an `id` to the `TreeItem` so that its selection and expansion state can be retained reliably when it gets changed.

```typescript
/**
 * Optional id for the tree item that has to be unique across tree. The id is used to preserve the selection and expansion state of the tree item.
 *
 * If not provided, an id is generated using the tree item's label. **Note** that when labels change, ids will change and that selection and expansion state cannot be kept stable anymore.
 */
id?: string;
```

### New menu group identifiers

Several menus now have new group identifiers for finer control on command placement:

**Explorer context menu**

* `navigation`:  Commands related to navigation across VS Code. As before this is the primary group of the explorer context menu.
* `2_workspace`: Commands related to workspace manipulation.
* `3_compare`: Commands related to comparing files in the diff editor.
* `4_search`: Commands related to searching in the search view.
* `5_cutcopypaste`: Commands related to cutting, copying and pasting of files.
* `7_modification`: Commands related to the modification of a files.

**Editor Tab context menu**

* `1_close`: Commands related to closing editors.
* `3_preview`: Commands related to pinning editors.

**Editor Title menu**

* `1_diff`: Commands related to working with diff editors.
* `3_open`: Commands related to opening editors.
* `5_close`: Commands related to closing editors.

### New keyboard shortcut context operator

Keyboard shortcut contexts allow users to control when keybindings are active. They are also referred to as [when](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_when-clause-contexts) clauses because they define *when* a keybinding is active or enabled. In this release, there is a new key-value pair operator for `when` clauses. The expression `key =~ value` treats the right hand side as a regular expression to match against the left hand side. For example, to contribute context menu items for all Docker files, one could use:

```json
   "when": "resourceFileName =~ *docker*"
```

### CodeActionProvider improvements

A `CodeActionProvider` can now return objects of the new `CodeAction` class. `CodeAction` adds additional metadata and functionality over `Command`, and better captures what Code Actions are and how they are used in VS Code's UI.

A `CodeAction` primarily consists of a `title`, `kind`, and at least a `Command` or (new in VS Code 1.20) a `WorkspaceEdit`.

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode'

/**
 * Quick fix provider that converts :) to 😀
 */
export class Emojizer implements vscode.CodeActionProvider {
    provideCodeActions(document: vscode.TextDocument, range: vscode.Range) {
        const pos = range.start;
        const line = document.lineAt(pos.line);

        // Check if we are at a :)
        if (line.text[pos.character] === ':' && line.text[pos.character + 1] === ')') {
            const fix = new vscode.CodeAction('Convert to 😀', vscode.CodeActionKind.QuickFix);
            fix.edit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();
            fix.edit.replace(document.uri, new vscode.Range(pos, pos.translate(0, 2)), '😀');
            return [fix];
        }
        return undefined;
    }
}
```

`CodeAction` also adds metadata about Code Actions, including the Code Action's kind (`vscode.CodeActionKind.QuickFix` in the example above) and the set of diagnostics that the Code Action addresses. We use this metadata to implement features such as the `Refactor` command and `vscode.action.codeAction` keybindings, and plan to build additional features using it in the future.

### Remove files from the Open Recent list

A new command `vscode.removeFromRecentlyOpened` removes entries from the **Open Recent** list in the **File** menu.

### Debug API

**Adding and removing breakpoints**

In this milestone, we've continued work on the breakpoints debug API. It is now possible to [add and remove](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/7636a7d6f7d2749833f783e94fd3d48d6a1791cb/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L282-L292) `SourceBreakpoints` and `FunctionBreakpointa`.

> **Note:** The breakpoints API is still proposed, so in order to use it, you must opt into it by adding a `"enableProposedApi": true` to `package.json` and you'll have to copy the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) into your extension project. Also be aware that you cannot publish an extension to the Marketplace that uses the `enableProposedApi` attribute.

**new `DebugConfigurationProvider.debugAdapterExecutable` replaces `adapterExecutableCommand` commands**

Currently a debugger extension can contribute the "hook"-like command `adapterExecutableCommand` to return a dynamically calculated path (and corresponding program arguments) of the debug adapter about to be launched by VS Code.
In this milestone, we are proposing "real" API that replaces the untyped command based mechanism with a typed solution. At the same time we are deprecating the `adapterExecutableCommand` command (and we will remove support for it as soon it is no longer used).

The new API is an optional method [`debugAdapterExecutable`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/7636a7d6f7d2749833f783e94fd3d48d6a1791cb/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L388-L395) on the `DebugConfigurationProvider` that returns the path and arguments wrapped as an `DebugAdapterExecutable` object. To make this new API even more flexible we are now passing the launch configuration as an argument.

**Command `vscode.logToDebugConsole` will be removed**

As [announced](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_18#_debug-api-updates) in the previous release, we have deprecated the  `vscode.logToDebugConsole` command in favor of real debug API. We plan to remove support for the `vscode.logToDebugConsole` command in the February milestone.

**Run a debug adapter inside the debug extension**

Developing a debugger extension typically involves debugging both the extension and the debug adapter in two parallel sessions. VS Code supports this nicely but development could be easier if both the extension and the debug adapter would be one program that could be debugged in one session.

In this milestone we've explored a way to run the debug adapter inside the extension. The basic idea is to
intercept the launch of a debug session in the `resolveDebugConfiguration` method of a `DebugConfigurationProvider` and starting to listen for connect requests and creating a new debug adapter session for every request. To make VS Code use connect requests (instead of always launching new debug adapter), the launch configuration is modified by adding the `debugServer` attribute to it.

These [lines of code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/042d19a27a8e3a08f27a24110506b53fbecc75ce/src/extension.ts#L61-L71) implement this approach for the "Mock Debug" extension (enable this feature by setting the compile time flag `EMBED_DEBUG_ADAPTER` to true).

## New Documentation

### Node.js deployment tutorials for Docker and Azure App Service

We have two new tutorials for [deploying Node.js applications](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-deployment) to Azure.

Tutorial | Description
--- | ---
[Deploy using Azure App Services](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/app-service-extension/getting-started) | Manage Azure resources directly in VS Code with the [Azure App Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) extension.
[Deploy using Docker](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/docker-extension/getting-started) | Deploy your website using a Docker container with the [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker) extension.

### Variable substitution reference

We added a [Variables Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference) describing VS Code's support for variable substitution (for example `${workspaceFolder}`, `${file}`) in your debugging and task configuration files.

### VS Code recipe for Vue.js

There is now a [Vue.js debugging recipe](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/vuejs-cli) to help configure the [Chrome debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) for applications which use the popular [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework.

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(editor.action.refactor)`|Open refactoring context menu at current position|`workbench.action.refactor`
`kb(workbench.action.moveEditorToFirstGroup)`|Move Editor into First Group|`workbench.action.moveEditorToFirstGroup`
`kb(workbench.action.moveEditorToSecondGroup)`|Move Editor into Second Group|`workbench.action.moveEditorToSecondGroup`
`kb(workbench.action.moveEditorToThirdGroup)`|Move Editor into Third Group|`workbench.action.moveEditorToThirdGroup`
`kb(list.expandSelectionDown)`|Multi-Select in lists/trees: expand selection down|`list.expandSelectionDown`
`kb(list.expandSelectionUp)`|Multi-Select in lists/trees: expand selection up|`list.expandSelectionUp`
`kb(workbench.action.openLogFile)`|Developer: Open Log File...|`workbench.action.openLogFile`
`kb(settings.action.editFocusedSetting)`|Edit focused setting in the Settings editor|`settings.action.editFocusedSetting`

Command `workbench.action.files.revealActiveFileInWindows` is a duplication of an already available command `revealFileInOS`. Therefore we are deprecating the `workbench.action.files.revealActiveFileInWindows` command in the January release and plan to drop it in February.

Command `workbench.action.files.copyPathOfActiveFile` is a duplication of an already available command `copyFilePath`. Therefore we are deprecating the `workbench.action.files.copyPathOfActiveFile` command in the January release and plan to drop it in February.
