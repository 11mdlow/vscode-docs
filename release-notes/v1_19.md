# November 2017 (version 1.19)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.19 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/54?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the November milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Pipe output directly into VS Code

We added support to pipe the output of a command directly into VS Code and have it open in an editor:

![Pipe Output](images/1_19/stdin.gif)

**Note:** The terminal command will wait until the editor is closed to make sure that all output is piped into the editor, even if it is received after the editor was already opened. This is the equivalent of running with `--wait`.

### New editor tabs layout option

A new setting, `workbench.editor.tabSizing`, was added to control how tabs should size depending on the space available in the outer container. The default (`fit`) works as before and will always ensure that the tab shows the entire name of the file. If space gets too little, a scroll bar will appear.

You can change this behavior by setting this new option to `shrink`. When space is little, tabs will shrink up to a minimum and thus make it less likely that a scroll bar appears.

### Compare file to Clipboard

You can now compare the contents of the currently opened file with the contents of the Clipboard. The command is **Compare Active File with Clipboard** (command id `workbench.files.action.compareWithClipboard`).

### New code --status option

A new command line argument was added to print some useful diagnostics information to the console. The idea is that you can share this information with us via GitHub issues and we will have a better understanding of the state of VS Code at the time of the issue.

Just run `code --status` from the command line while VS Code is running and after a moment, you will get something like this:

![Status](images/1_19/status.png)

The status includes information about the environment, all running processes, and the counts of some typical files in the workspace.

## Editor

### Smarter IntelliSense

VS Code IntelliSense re-sorts suggestions as you type. This ensures that the most relevant suggestions are near the top. However, there are cases in which multiple suggestions match equally well, for example `con` matches on `confirm`, `console`, `const`, and `constructor` equally well and lexicographic sort decides which suggestion is pre-selected.

In this release, we've updated IntelliSense to remember what you have selected in such cases. Select `const` for the `con` prefix once and it will be the top match in the future.

![IntelliSense Memory](images/1_19/suggest_mem.gif)

Sometimes when you are typing, you may accidentally mix up neighboring characters, for instance instead of `console`, you might type `cnosole`, or `resutl` instead of `result`. We have made IntelliSense more relaxed and it will now try a few permutation when scoring suggestions.

![IntelliSense Relaxed](images/1_19/suggest_relax.png)

In the sample above, IntelliSense favors the `console` suggestion by changing `cnos` to `cons` as that match is stronger then the match of `cnos` on `RTCIceTransportStateChangedEvent`.

### Folding improvements

`Shift + Click` on the folding icons not only folds/unfolds the corresponding section but also all its children.

New folding regions have been added for the following languages:

* CSS/Less/SCSS: `/*#region*/` and `/*#endregion*/`
* Coffeescript: `#region` and `#endregion`
* PHP: `#region` and `#endregion`
* Bat: `::#region` and `::#endregion`

Note: If you don't remember a folding marker, just type `#` at the beginning of a line and do code completion. Each language proposes completion proposals or snippets.

New folding commands have been added:

* Fold Regions (`kb(editor.foldAllMarkerRegions)`) folds all regions from markers (for example `#region`).
* Unfold Regions (`kb(editor.unfoldAllMarkerRegions)`) unfolds all regions from markers.
* Fold All Block Comments (`kb(editor.foldAllBlockComments)`) folds all regions that start with a block comment token (for example `/*`).

## Languages

### HTML

HTML now offers code completion for character entities, such as `&gt;`, `&amp`. To see the proposals, type `&` in a element content or attribute value and invoke IntelliSense.

### JSON

A new mode *JSON with Comments* has been added to distinguish between JSON-like files that allow comments and JSON files that follow the standard JSON specification. All VSCode configuration file use the new mode and allow comments, while `.json` files default to the standard JSON mode that will report comments as errors.

### TypeScript 2.6.2

VS Code now includes TypeScript 2.6.2. This minor update fixes a [few important bug fixes and tooling improvements](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22TypeScript+2.6.2%22+is%3Aclosed).

### Support For JSX Fragement Syntax

TypeScript 2.6.2 also brings support for React 16.2's [new JSX fragment syntax](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/11/28/react-v16.2.0-fragment-support.html#jsx-fragment-syntax)
