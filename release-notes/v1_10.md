## Workbench

### Configurable Explorer Keybindings

By popular demand, you can now configure the keybindings for most of the commands in the File Explorer and OPEN EDITORS view.

The following commands could already be assigned prior to version 1.10 in the File Explorer:

* `explorer.newFile` - create a new file
* `explorer.newFolder`-  create a new folder

New commands that work in both File Explorer and OPEN EDITORS view

* `explorer.openToSide` - opening to the side
* `explorer.copyPath` - copy path of file/folder
* `explorer.revealInOS` - reveal file in OS

New commands that only work in the File Explorer:

* `filesExplorer.copy` - copy a file from the File Explorer
* `filesExplorer.paste` - paste a file that was copied from the File Explorer
* `filesExplorer.rename` - rename a file/folder in File Explorer
* `filesExplorer.moveFileToTrash` - move a file/folder to trash from File Explorer
* `filesExplorer.deleteFile` - bypass trash and delete a file/folder from File Explorer
* `filesExplorer.findInFolder` - find inside a folder from the File Explorer

In addition to these commands, the following contexts are introduced for keybindings:

* `filesExplorerFocus` - keyboard focus is inside the File Explorer
* `openEditorsFocus` - keyboard focus is inside the OPEN EDITORS view
* `explorerViewletFocus` - keyboard focus is in either File Explorer or OPEN EDITORS

### Configurable Tree/List Keybindings

We introduced new commands (see below) to make working with trees and lists in VS Code more configurable for keyboard centric users.

Here is a list of new commands that will work in every tree and list:

|Command|Keybinding|
|---|---|
|`list.focusUp`|`kbstyle(Up Arrow)` (additionally on macOS: `kbstyle(Ctrl+P)`)|
|`list.focusDown`|`kbstyle(Down Arrow)` (additionally on macOS: `kbstyle(Ctrl+N)`)|
|`list.focusFirst`|`kbstyle(Home)`|
|`list.focusLast`|`kbstyle(End)`|
|`list.focusPageDown`|`kbstyle(PageDown)`|
|`list.focusPageUp`|`kbstyle(PageUp)`|
|`list.collapse`|`kbstyle(Left Arrow)` (additionally on macOS: `kbstyle(Cmd+Up Arrow)`)|
|`list.expand`|`kbstyle(Right Arrow)`|
|`list.clear`|`kbstyle(Escape)`|
|`list.select`|`kbstyle(Enter)` (additionally on macOS: `kbstyle(Cmd+Enter)`)|
|`list.toggleExpand`|`kbstyle(Space)`|

Given these commands, we are now also consistently supporting `kbstyle(Ctrl+P)` and `kbstyle(Ctrl+N)` to navigate up and down in trees and lists on macOS.

For example on macOS to change the command to open from the Files Explorer to be `kbstyle(Enter)` (which normally brings you into rename mode), configure:

```json
{
	"key": "enter",
	"command": "list.select",
	"when": "filesExplorerFocus"
}
```

### Configurable Window Title

We introduced a new setting `window.title` that can be used to change the window title based on the active editor opened.

You can compose the title with the following variables (shown here for `/Users/Development/myProject/myFile.txt`):

* `${activeEditorName}` - myFile.txt
* `${activeFilePath}` - /Users/Development/myProject/myFile.txt
* `${rootName}` - myProject
* `${rootPath}` - /Users/Development/myProject
* `${appName}` - Visual Studio Code
* `${dirty}` - a dirty indicator if the active editor is dirty
* `${separator}` - a conditional separator (" - ") that only shows when surrounded by variables with values

The `window.title` has the following defaults:

* Windows/Linux: `${dirty}${activeEditorName}${separator}${rootName}${separator}${appName}`
* macOS: `${activeEditorName}${separator}${rootName}`

Note: We no longer support `window.showFullPath` in favor of `window.title` setting. The variable `${activeFilePath}` will give you the full path.

### More Keybindings in Menus

You might have noticed that an entry in the menu might not show a keybinding even though you have a keybinding assigned. The reason was that some keybindings (for example chords) cannot be displayed as keybinding in menus (including context menus).

As a workaround, we are now showing those keybindings as part of the label:

![menu](images/1_10/menu.png)

### Restore Zen Mode

Per [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19431), we have added a `zenMode.restore` setting to control if a window should restore to Zen Mode if it was exited in Zen Mode.

### Links in the terminal

The terminal now creates links for URLs and text that looks like a path, these will be opened in a browser or the editor when triggered respectively.

![terminal link](images/1_10/terminal-link.png)

## Editor

### Save Participants Trigger

You can now save an editor via `kb(workbench.action.files.save)` even if the file is not dirty and save participants will be triggered. This allows you to trigger Format on Save even if the file is not dirty.

## Task support

### Keybindings per task

You can now bind a keyboard shortcut to any task you want.

Simply add a keybinding like this:

```json
{
	"key": "ctrl+h",
	"command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
	"args": "tsc"
}
```

This binds `ctrl+h` to the task named `tsc`.

### More work on Terminal Runner

As announced in the previous release, we are working on running tasks in the Integrated Terminal instead of the Output panel. In this release, we added support to compose tasks out of simplier tasks. If, for example, you have a workspace with a client and server folder and both contain a build script, you can now have one task that starts both build scripts in separate terminals.

The `tasks.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "taskName": "Client Build",
            "command": "gulp",
            "args": ["build"],
            "isShellCommand": true,
            "options": {
                "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}/client"
            }
        },
        {
            "taskName": "Server Build",
            "command": "gulp",
            "args": ["build"],
            "isShellCommand": true,
            "options": {
                "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}/server"
            }
        },
        {
            "taskName": "Build",
            "dependsOn": ["Client Build", "Server Build"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Please note the following things:

- This support is preliminary and subject to change.
- The terminal task runner can now also be enabled by using the `"version": "2.0.0"` property.

## Languages

## Extensions

## Debugging

### Column Breakpoints

TODO@Isidor

### Precondition Based on Debug Type

It is now possible to have a precondition based on the current debug type. Preconditions can be used when defining keyboard shortcuts or when registering new commands as an extension.

Here's an example of a shortcut that will only be enabled while you are debugging `node`:

```json
{ "key": "f6", "command": "workbench.action.debug.continue", "when": "debugType == 'node'" }
```

### Debug Views Sizes

We have fine tuned the default sizes of Debug views. Also once the size is changed by the user, we preserve it across different VS Code sessions.

### Unsaved File Debugging

It is now possible to simply debug a single file that was just created and not yet saved in VS Code. This helps with scenarios when you are opening a new file in VS Code from the command line and just want to press `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to start debugging.

## Node Debugging

## Extension Authoring

### Default Language specific editor settings

With this release, extension authors can contribute default language specific editor settings using the newly introduced extension point `configurationDefaults` in `package.json`. Following sample, contributes default editor settings for `markdown` language.

```json
contributes": {
	"configurationDefaults": {
		"[mardown]": {
			"editor.wrappingColumn": 0,
			"editor.quickSuggestions": false
		}
	}
}
```
