# February 2017 (version 1.10)

Welcome to the February 2017 release of Visual Studio Code. There are a number of significant updates in this version that we hope you will like, some of the key highlights include:

* **[Highlight 1](#highlight-1)** - TBD highlight.
* **[Highlight 2](#highlight-2)** - TBD highlight.

The release notes are arranged in the following sections related to VS Code focus areas. Here are some further updates:

* **[Workbench](#workbench)** - TBD other section highlights.
* **[Editor](#editor)** - TBD other section highlights.
* **[Languages](#languages)** - TBD other section highlights.
* **[Extensions](#extensions)** - TBD other section highlights.
* **[Debugging](#debugging)** - TBD other section highlights.
* **[Node.js Debugging](#node-debugging)** - TBD other section highlights.
* **[Extension Authoring](#extension-authoring)** - TBD other section highlights.

## Workbench

### Highlight 1

Small test of kbstyles versus kb tag

* `kbstyle(Ctrl+Shift+P)`
* <kb>Ctrl+Shift+C</kb>
* <kb>Ctrl</kb>+<kb>Shift</kb>+<kb>C</kb>
* `kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`

### `zenMode.restore`
Per [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19431) we have introduced a `"zenMode.restore"` setting to control if a window should restore to zen mode if it was exited in zen mode.

## Editor

## Languages

### Highlight 2

## Extensions

## Debugging

### Column Breakpoints

### Precondition Based on Debug Type
It is now possible to have a precondition based on the current debug type. Preconditions can be used when definining keyboard shortcuts or when registering new commands as an extension. Here's an example of a shortcut that will only be enabled while you are debugging `node`.
```json
{ "key": "f6", "command": "workbench.action.debug.continue", "when": "debugType == 'node'" }
```

### Debug Views Sizes
We have fine tuned the default sizes of debug views in the debug viewlet. Also once the size is changed by the user now we preserve it across different VS Code sessions.

### Unsaved File Debugging
It is now possible to simply debug a single file that was just created and not yet saved in VS Code. This helps a lot with a scenario when you are opening a new file in VS Code from the command line and just want to press `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to start debugging.
