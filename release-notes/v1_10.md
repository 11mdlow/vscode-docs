The release notes are arranged in the following sections related to VS Code focus areas. Here are some further updates:

* **[Workbench](#workbench)** - TBD other section highlights.
* **[Editor](#editor)** - TBD other section highlights.
* **[Languages](#languages)** - TBD other section highlights.
* **[Extensions](#extensions)** - TBD other section highlights.
* **[Debugging](#debugging)** - TBD other section highlights.

* **[Extension Authoring](#extension-authoring)** - TBD other section highlights.

## Workbench

### Configurable Explorer Keybindings

By popular demand, you can now configure the keybindings for most of the commands in the File Explorer and OPEN EDITORS view.

The following commands could already be assigned prior to version 1.10 in the File Explorer:

* `explorer.newFile` - create a new file
* `explorer.newFolder`-  create a new folder

New commands that work in both File Explorer and OPEN EDITORS view

* `explorer.openToSide` - opening to the side
* `explorer.copyPath` - copy path of file/folder
* `explorer.revealInOS` - reveal file in OS

New commands that only work in the File Explorer:

* `filesExplorer.open` -  opening a file from the File Explorer
* `filesExplorer.copy` - copy a file from the File Explorer
* `filesExplorer.paste` - paste a file that was copied from the File Explorer
* `filesExplorer.rename` - rename a file/folder in File Explorer
* `filesExplorer.moveFileToTrash` - move a file/folder to trash from File Explorer
* `filesExplorer.deleteFile` - bypass trash and delete a file/folder from File Explorer
* `filesExplorer.findInFolder` - find inside a folder from the File Explorer

New commands that only work in the OPEN EDITORS view:

* `openEditors.open` - opening an editor from the OPEN EDITORS view

The reason why there are 2 different commands for opening is that the File Explorer has the capability of renaming and so `kbstyle(Enter)` will trigger rename and not opening. 

In addition to these commands, the following contexts are introduced for keybindings:

* `filesExplorerFocus` - keyboard focus is inside the File Explorer
* `openEditorsFocus` - keyboard focus is inside the OPEN EDITORS view
* `explorerViewletFocus` - keyboard focus is in either File Explorer or OPEN EDITORS

For example on macOS to change the command to open from the Explorer to be `kbstyle(Enter)`:

```json
{
	"key": "enter",
	"command": "filesExplorer.open",
	"when": "filesExplorerFocus"
}
```

### Configurable Tree/List Keybindings

We introduced new commands (see below) to make working with trees and lists in VS Code more configurable for keyboard centric users.

Here is a list of new commands that will work in every tree and list:

|Command|Keybinding|
|---|---|
|`list.focusUp`|`kbstyle(Up Arrow)`|
|`list.focusDown`|`kbstyle(Down Arrow)`|
|`list.focusFirst`|`kbstyle(Home)`|
|`list.focusLast`|`kbstyle(End)`|
|`list.focusPageDown`|`kbstyle(PageDown)`|
|`list.focusPageUp`|`kbstyle(PageUp)`|
|`list.collapse`|`kbstyle(Left Arrow)`|
|`list.expand`|`kbstyle(Right Arrow)`|
|`list.clear`|`kbstyle(Escape)`|
|`list.select`|`kbstyle(Enter)`|
|`list.toggleExpand`|`kbstyle(Space)`|

Given these commands, we are now also consistently supporting `kbstyle(Ctrl+P)` and `kbstyle(Ctrl+N)` to navigate up and down in trees and lists on macOS. 

### Configurable Window Title

We introduced a new setting `window.title` that can be used to change the window title based on the active editor opened. 

You can compose the title with the following variables (shown here for `/Users/Development/myProject/myFile.txt`):

* `${activeEditorName}` - myFile.txt
* `${activeFilePath}` - /Users/Development/myProject/myFile.txt
* `${rootName}` - myProject
* `${rootPath}` - /Users/Development/myProject
* `${appName}` - Visual Studio Code
* `${dirty}` - a dirty indicator if the active editor is dirty
* `${separator}` - a conditional separator (" - ") that only shows when surrounded by variables with values

The `window.title` has the following defaults:

* Windows/Linux: `${dirty}${activeEditorName}${separator}${rootName}${separator}${appName}`
* macOS: `${activeEditorName}${separator}${rootName}`

Note: We no longer support `window.showFullPath` in favor of `window.title` setting. The variable `${activeFilePath}` will give you the full path. 

### More Keybindings in Menus

You might have noticed that an entry in the menu might not show a keybinding even though you have a keybinding assigned. The reason was that some keybindings (for example chords) cannot be displayed as keybinding in menus (including context menus). 

As a workaround, we are now showing those keybindings as part of the label:

### Restore Zen Mode

Per [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19431), we have added a `zenMode.restore` setting to control if a window should restore to Zen Mode if it was exited in Zen Mode.

## Editor

### Save Participants Trigger

You can now save an editor via `kb(workbench.action.files.save)` even if the file is not dirty and save participants will be triggered. This allows you to trigger Format on Save even if the file is not dirty.

## Languages

## Extensions

## Debugging

### Column Breakpoints

### Precondition Based on Debug Type

It is now possible to have a precondition based on the current debug type. Preconditions can be used when defining keyboard shortcuts or when registering new commands as an extension. 

Here's an example of a shortcut that will only be enabled while you are debugging `node`:

```json
{ "key": "f6", "command": "workbench.action.debug.continue", "when": "debugType == 'node'" }
```

### Debug Views Sizes

We have fine tuned the default sizes of Debug views. Also once the size is changed by the user, we preserve it across different VS Code sessions.

### Unsaved File Debugging

It is now possible to simply debug a single file that was just created and not yet saved in VS Code. This helps with scenarios when you are opening a new file in VS Code from the command line and just want to press `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to start debugging.
