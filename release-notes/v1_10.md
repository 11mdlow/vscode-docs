## Workbench

### Configurable Explorer Keybindings

Upon popular demand, you can now configure the keybindings for most of the commands in the files explorer and open editors view.

The following commands could already be assigned prior to version 1.10 in the files explorer:
* `explorer.newFile`: create a new file
* `explorer.newFolder`: create a new folder

New commands that work in both files explorer and opened editors view
* `explorer.openToSide`: opening to the side
* `explorer.copyPath`: copy path of file/folder
* `explorer.revealInOS`: reveal file in OS

New commands that only work in the files explorer
* `filesExplorer.open`: opening a file from the files explorer
* `filesExplorer.copy`: copy a file from the files explorer
* `filesExplorer.paste`: paste a file that was copied from the files explorer
* `filesExplorer.rename`: rename a file/folder in files explorer
* `filesExplorer.moveFileToTrash`: move a file/folder to trash from files explorer
* `filesExplorer.deleteFile`: bypass trash and delete a file/folder from files explorer
* `filesExplorer.findInFolder`: find inside a folder from the files explorer

New commands that only work in the opened editors view
* `openEditors.open`: opening an editor from the opened editors view

The reason why there are 2 different commands for opening is that the files explorer has the capability of renaming and so `Enter` will trigger rename and not opening. 

In addition to these commands, the following contexts are introduced for keybindings:
* `filesExplorerFocus`: keyboard focus is inside the files explorer
* `openEditorsFocus`: keyboard focus is inside the opened editors view
* `explorerViewletFocus`: keyboard focus is in either of the two

For example on macOS for changing the command to open from the explorer to be `Enter`:

```json
{
	"key": "enter",
	"command": "filesExplorer.open",
	"when": "filesExplorerFocus"
}
```

### Configurable Tree/List Keybindings

We introduced new commands (see below) to make working with trees and lists in VS Code more configurable for keyboard centric users.

Here is a list of new commands that will work in every tree and list:

|Command|Keybinding|
|---|---|
|`list.focusUp`|<kbd>Up Arrow<kbd>|
|`list.focusDown`|<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>|
|`list.focusFirst`|<kbd>Home</kbd>|
|`list.focusLast`|<kbd>End</kbd>|
|`list.focusPageDown`|<kbd>Page Down</kbd>|
|`list.focusPageUp`|<kbd>Page Up</kbd>|
|`list.collapse`|<kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>|
|`list.expand`|<kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>|
|`list.clear`|<kbd>Escape</kbd>|
|`list.select`|<kbd>Enter</kbd>|
|`list.toggleExpand`|<kbd>Space</kbd>|

Given these commands we are now also consistently supporting <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+N</kbd> to navigate up and down in trees and lists on macOS. 

### Configurable Window Title

We introduced a new setting `window.title` that can be used to change the window title based on the active editor opened. You can compose the title with the following variables:
* `${activeEditorName}`: e.g. myFile.txt
* `${activeFilePath}`: e.g. /Users/Development/myProject/myFile.txt
* `${rootName}`: e.g. myProject
* `${rootPath}`: e.g. /Users/Development/myProject
* `${appName}`: e.g. VS Code
* `${dirty}`: a dirty indicator if the active editor is dirty
* `${separator}`: a conditional separator (" - ") that only shows when surrounded by variables with values

The title has a default value that matches todays behaviour:
* Windows/Linux: `${dirty}${activeEditorName}${separator}${rootName}${separator}${appName}`
* macOS: `${activeEditorName}${separator}${rootName}`

Note: we no longer support `window.showFullPath` in favour of `window.title` setting. The variable `${activeFilePath}` will give you the full path. 

### More Keybindings in Menus

You might have noticed that an entry in the menu might show without keybinding even though you have a keybinding assigned. The reason for this is that some keybindings (for example chords) cannot be displayed as keybinding in menus (including context menus). 

As a workaround we are now showing those keybindings as part of the label because we think it is still important to show them to you:

### Restore Zen Mode

Per [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19431), we have added a `"zenMode.restore"` setting to control if a window should restore to Zen Mode if it was exited in Zen Mode.

## Editor

### Save Participants Trigger

You can now save an editor via `kb(workbench.action.files.save)` even if the file is not dirty and save participants will be triggered. This allows you to trigger format on save even if the file is not dirty.

### Precondition Based on Debug Type

It is now possible to have a precondition based on the current debug type. Preconditions can be used when defining keyboard shortcuts or when registering new commands as an extension. 

Here's an example of a shortcut that will only be enabled while you are debugging `node`:

```json
{ "key": "f6", "command": "workbench.action.debug.continue", "when": "debugType == 'node'" }
```

### Debug Views Sizes

We have fine tuned the default sizes of Debug views. Also once the size is changed by the user now we preserve it across different VS Code sessions.

### Unsaved File Debugging

It is now possible to simply debug a single file that was just created and not yet saved in VS Code. This helps with scenarios when you are opening a new file in VS Code from the command line and just want to press `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to start debugging.
