## Contributions to Extensions

Our team maintains or contributes to a number of VS Code extensions. Most notably:

* [Go](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lukehoban.Go)
* [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint)
* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
* [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome)
* [VSCodeVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)

In addition, we released an [early-stage PHP parser](https://github.com/Microsoft/tolerant-php-parser) designed for IDE usage scenarios. This will help extension authors provide even better tooling support for PHP. The parser is written in PHP, and is built to be fast + memory-efficient, provide graceful error-handling, and produce fully-representative trees (including comments/whitespace).
