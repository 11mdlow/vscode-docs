# May 2017 (version 1.13)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.13 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26068)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+milestone%3A%22May+2017%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs in the April milestone.
* **[Closed feature requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+2017%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afeature-request)** - Implemented feature requests.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Preserving view state for resource editors

We are now preserving the view state for resource editors when you switch between them. This comes in handy when debugging internal modules since we now preserve the scroll position and all other view data for internal module editors. However, we always clear the view state when a user closes the editor.

## Debugging

### Improved stepping performance

As per [user recommendation](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25605), after a debug step we are first retrieving the top of the stack frame and after asynchronously retrieving the rest of the stack frames and the variables. The impact of this is improved stepping performance. For comparison here is a gif showing old and new stepping performance while debugging the large [Typescript repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)

### debug.internalConsoleOptions

It is now possible to control the behavior of the Debug Console using the setting `"debug.internalConsoleOptions"`. Previously this setting was only available in `launch.json`, however by [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18398) it is now possible to also specify this in user and workspace settings. The setting in `launch.json` takes precedence if both are provided.

## Languages

### Syntax coloring for JSX/TSX components

In React JSX and TSX files, component classes are now colored differently than normal HTML elements:

### TypeScript symbol search includes filename

You can use workspace symbol search (`kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)`) to quickly find symbols in JavaScript and TypeScript projects. The list of results now includes the filename of each symbol:

### `Open TS Server Log` reveals log folder

The `TypeScript: Open TS Server Log` command now reveals the TypeScript log directory on your operating system instead of trying to open the log file in VS Code. This is useful for collecting the additional typings installer log files generated alongside the main `tsserver.log` file.

### Markdown symbol search includes heading levels

You can quickly jump to a heading in a Markdown file using **Go to Symbol in File...** (`kb(workbench.action.gotoSymbol)`). This list now includes the heading level of each symbol, which allows you to quickly filter results by heading level.
