## Workbench

### Theming

We received a lot of feedback for our workbench theming support and are happy to see more and more themes adopting the workbench colors! During this milestone, we added some new colors as well as did some tweaks to existing colors.

New colors introduced:

Key|Description
---|-------
`selection.background`|The background color of text selections in the workbench (for input fields or text areas). Note that this does not apply to selections within the editor and the terminal.
`input.placeholderForeground`|Input box foreground color for placeholder text.
`list.inactiveSelectionForeground`|List/Tree foreground color for the selected item when the list/tree is inactive. An active list/tree has keyboard focus, an inactive does not.
`list.hoverForeground`|List/Tree foreground when hovering over items using the mouse.
`list.focusForeground`|List/Tree foreground color for the focused item when the list/tree is active. An active list/tree has keyboard focus, an inactive does not.
`badge.foreground`|Badge foreground color. Badges are small information labels, for example, Search results count.
`badge.background`|Badge background color.
`progressBar.background`|Background color of the progress bar that can show for long running operations.
`editorCodeLens.foreground`|Foreground color of an editor CodeLens.
`editorBracketMatch.background`|Background color behind matching brackets.
`editorBracketMatch.border`|Color for matching brackets boxes.
`editorRuler.foreground`|Color of the editor rulers.
`editorOverviewRuler.border`|Color of the overview ruler border.
`errorForeground`|Overall foreground color for error messages. This color is only used if not overridden by a component.
`editorWidgetBorder`|Border color of the editor widget.
`editorGutter.background`|Background color of the editor gutter. The gutter contains the glyph margins and the line numbers.
`peekViewEditorGutter.background`|Background color of the gutter in the peek view editor.

Existing colors behavior changed:

Key|Description
---|-------
`panel.border`|Now overwrites the value of `contrastBorder`, allowing a more specific color if `contrastBorder` is set.
`tab.border`|Now overwrites the value of `contrastBorder`, allowing a more specific color if `contrastBorder` is set.
`editorGroup.border`|Now overwrites the value of `contrastBorder`, allowing a more specific color if `contrastBorder` is set.
`list.*`|All list colors can now be set even in the presence of `contrastBorder` and `contrastActiveBorder`.

### High Contrast theme

We have improved the High Contrast theme to include more token colors and to use selection and Status Bar colors for clearer contrast.

### Preserving view state for resource editors

We are now preserving the view state for resource editors when you switch between them. This comes in handy when debugging internal modules since we now preserve the scroll position and all other view data for internal module editors. However, we always clear the view state when a user closes the editor.

### Disable menu bar mnemonics

A new setting `window.enableMenuBarMnemonics` was added to disable all mnemonics (hot keys) in the menu bar (on Windows and Linux). This frees up some `kbstyle(Alt+)` keyboard shortcuts to bind to other commands.

### Install Additional SCM Providers

We have introduced a new command **Install Additional SCM Providers...** to make it easier to discover and install SCM providers from the VS Code Marketplace.

## Debugging

### Improved stepping performance

Per a [user recommendation](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25605), after a debug step, we first retrieve the top stack frame and then asynchronously retrieve the rest of the stack frames and the variables. The impact of this is improved stepping performance. For comparison, here are videos showing the old and new stepping performance while debugging the large [Typescript repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).

Full stack when stepping:

### Copy All action in Debug Console

It is now possible to copy all the content from the Debug Console using a context menu action **Copy All**. More details about what motivated this change can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2163).

### Default position of the Debug toolbar

To help with the [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2513) of the Debug toolbar covering editor tabs, we changed the default position of the Debug toolbar from center to the utmost right. Double clicking on the drag handle will also move the Debug toolbar all the way to the right.

### debug.internalConsoleOptions

It is now possible to control the behavior of the Debug Console using the setting `"debug.internalConsoleOptions"`. Previously this setting was only available in `launch.json`, however by [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18398) it is now possible to also specify this in user and workspace settings. The setting in `launch.json` takes precedence if both are provided.

## Languages

### Syntax coloring for JSX/TSX components

In React JSX and TSX files, component classes are now colored differently than normal HTML elements:

### TypeScript symbol search includes filename

You can use workspace symbol search (`kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)`) to quickly find symbols in JavaScript and TypeScript projects. The list of results now includes the filename of each symbol:

![symbol search includes filename](images/1_13/typescript-workspace-symbol-names.png)

### Open TS Server Log reveals log folder

The **TypeScript: Open TS Server Log** command now reveals the TypeScript log directory on your operating system instead of trying to open the log file in VS Code. This is useful for collecting the additional typings installer log files generated alongside the main `tsserver.log` file.

### Markdown symbol search includes heading levels

You can quickly jump to a heading in a Markdown file using **Go to Symbol in File...** (`kb(workbench.action.gotoSymbol)`). This list now includes the heading level of each symbol, which allows you to quickly filter results by heading level.
