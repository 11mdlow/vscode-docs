## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.13 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26068)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+milestone%3A%22May+2017%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs in the April milestone.
* **[Closed feature requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+2017%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afeature-request)** - Implemented feature requests.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Preserving view state for resource editors

We are now preserving the view state for resource editors when you switch between them. This comes in handy when debugging internal modules since we now preserve the scroll position and all other view data for internal module editors. However, we always clear the view state when a user closes the editor.

## Debugging

### debug.internalConsoleOptions

It is now possible to control the behavior of the Debug Console using the setting `"debug.internalConsoleOptions"`. Previously this setting was only available in `launch.json`, however by [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18398) it is now possible to also specify this in user and workspace settings. The setting in `launch.json` takes precedence if both are provided.

## Thank You

Last but certainly not least, a big *__Thank You!__* to the following folks that helped to make VS Code even better:
