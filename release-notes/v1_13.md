## Workbench

### Theming

We received a lot of feedback for our workbench theming support and are happy to see more and more themes adopting the workbench colors! During this milestone, we added some new colors as well as did some tweaks to existing colors.

New workbench colors introduced:

Key|Description
---|-------
`selection.background`|The background color of text selections in the workbench (for input fields or text areas). Note that this does not apply to selections within the editor and the terminal.
`input.placeholderForeground`|Input box foreground color for placeholder text.
`list.inactiveSelectionForeground`|List/Tree foreground color for the selected item when the list/tree is inactive. An active list/tree has keyboard focus, an inactive does not.
`list.hoverForeground`|List/Tree foreground when hovering over items using the mouse.
`list.focusForeground`|List/Tree foreground color for the focused item when the list/tree is active. An active list/tree has keyboard focus, an inactive does not.
`badge.foreground`|Badge foreground color. Badges are small information labels, for example, search results count.
`badge.background`|Badge background color.
`progressBar.background`|Background color of the progress bar shown for long running operations.
`sideBar.foreground`|Side Bar foreground color. The Side Bar is the container for views like Explorer and Search.
`sideBar.border`|Side Bar border color on the side separating the editor.
`sideBarSectionHeader.foreground`|Side Bar section header foreground color.
`statusBar.border`|Status Bar border color separating the Status Bar and editor. The Status Bar is at the bottom of the window.
`statusBar.debuggingForeground`|Status Bar foreground color when a program is being debugged.
`statusBar.noFolderForeground`|Status Bar foreground color when no folder is opened.
`activityBar.border`|Activity Bar border color with the Side Bar. The Activity Bar is on the far left or right and lets you switch between views of the Side Bar.
`extensionButton.prominentForeground`|Extension view button foreground color (for example **Install** button).
`extensionButton.prominentBackground`|Extension view button background color.
`extensionButton.prominentHoverBackground`|Extension view button background hover color.
`errorForeground`|Overall foreground color for error messages. This color is only used if not overridden by a component.
`tab.unfocusedActiveForeground`|Active tab foreground color in an inactive editor group.
`tab.unfocusedInactiveForeground`|Inactive tab foreground color in an inactive editor group.
`editorGroupHeader.tabsBorder`|Border color of the editor group title header when tabs are enabled. Editor groups are the containers of editors.
`welcomePage.buttonBackground`|Background color for the buttons on the Welcome page.
`welcomePage.buttonHoverBackground`|Hover background color for the buttons on the Welcome page.
`walkThrough.embeddedEditorBackground`|Background color for the embedded editors on the Interactive Playground.

New editor colors introduced:

Key|Description
---|-------
`editorCodeLens.foreground`|Foreground color of an editor CodeLens.
`editorBracketMatch.background`|Background color behind matching brackets.
`editorBracketMatch.border`|Color for matching brackets boxes.
`editorRuler.foreground`|Color of the editor rulers.
`editorOverviewRuler.border`|Color of the overview ruler border.
`editorWidgetBorder`|Border color of the editor widget.
`editorError.foreground`|Foreground color of error squigglies in the editor.
`editorError.border`|Border color of error squigglies in the editor.
`editorWarning.foreground`|Foreground color of warning squigglies in the editor.
`editorWarning.border`|Border color of warning squigglies in the editor.
`peekViewEditorGutter.background`|Background color of the gutter in the peek view editor.
`editorGutter.background`|Background color of the editor gutter. The gutter contains the glyph margins and the line numbers.
`editorGutter.modifiedBackground`|Editor gutter background color for lines that are modified.
`editorGutter.addedBackground`|Editor gutter background color for lines that are added.
`editorGutter.deletedBackground`|Editor gutter background color for lines that are deleted.

Existing color behavior changes:

Key|Description
---|-------
`panel.border`|Now overwrites the value of `contrastBorder`, allowing a more specific color if `contrastBorder` is set.
`tab.border`|Now overwrites the value of `contrastBorder`, allowing a more specific color if `contrastBorder` is set.
`editorGroup.border`|Now overwrites the value of `contrastBorder`, allowing a more specific color if `contrastBorder` is set.
`list.*`|All list colors can now be set even in the presence of `contrastBorder` and `contrastActiveBorder`.

Removed colors:

Key|Description
---|-------
`panel.background`|This color was not useful because the editor and tree used in panels did not pick up the background.

### High Contrast theme

We have improved the High Contrast theme to include more token colors and to use selection and Status Bar colors for clearer contrast.

### Preserving view state for resource editors

We are now preserving the view state for resource editors when you switch between them. This comes in handy when debugging internal modules since we now preserve the scroll position and all other view data for internal module editors. However, we always clear the view state when a user closes the editor.

### Disable menu bar mnemonics

A new setting `window.enableMenuBarMnemonics` was added to disable all mnemonics (hot keys) in the menu bar (on Windows and Linux). This frees up some `kbstyle(Alt+)` keyboard shortcuts to bind to other commands.

### Install Additional SCM Providers

We have introduced a new command **Install Additional SCM Providers...** to make it easier to discover and install SCM providers from the VS Code Marketplace. The command is available under the **Switch SCM Provider...** command in the Source Control view and **SCM: Switch SCM Provider** in the **Command Palette**.

![Install Additional SCM Providers](images/1_13/additional-scm-providers.png)

### Filenames in symbol search results

You can use workspace symbol search (`kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)`) to quickly find symbols in your workspace. The list of results now includes the filename of each symbol:

![symbol search includes filename](images/1_13/typescript-workspace-symbol-names.png)

### Go to Implementation and Go to Type Definition added to the Go Menu

The **Go** menu now includes the **Go to Implementation** and **Go to Type Definition** commands:

## Debugging

### Improved stepping performance

Per a [user recommendation](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25605), after a debug step, we first retrieve the top stack frame and then asynchronously retrieve the rest of the stack frames and the variables. The impact of this is improved stepping performance. For comparison, here are videos showing the old and new stepping performance while debugging the large [Typescript repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).

Full stack when stepping:

Top stack frame with stepping:

![step after](images/1_13/step-after.gif)

### Copy All action in Debug Console

It is now possible to copy all the content from the Debug Console using a context menu action **Copy All**. More details about what motivated this change can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2163).

![copy all](images/1_13/copy-all.png)

### Default position of the Debug toolbar

To help with the [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2513) of the Debug toolbar covering editor tabs, we changed the default position of the Debug toolbar from center to the utmost right. Double clicking on the drag handle will also move the Debug toolbar all the way to the right.

### debug.internalConsoleOptions

It is now possible to control the behavior of the Debug Console using the setting `"debug.internalConsoleOptions"`. Previously this setting was only available in `launch.json`, however by [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18398) it is now possible to also specify this in user and workspace settings. The setting in `launch.json` takes precedence if both are provided.

## Languages

### Syntax coloring for JSX/TSX components

In React JSX and TSX files, component classes are now colored differently than normal HTML elements:

![new jsx coloring](images/1_13/jsx-new-coloring.png)

### Additional JSDoc tags in hover and suggestions

JSDoc tags such as `@deprecated` and `@private` are now displayed in hover and suggestions documentation.

![JSDocs tags sections](images/1_13/jsdocs.png)

### Open TS Server Log reveals log folder

The **TypeScript: Open TS Server Log** command now reveals the TypeScript log directory on your operating system instead of trying to open the log file in VS Code. This is useful for collecting the additional typings installer log files generated alongside the main `tsserver.log` file.

### Markdown preview preserves scroll position

The Markdown preview, along with other webview based views such as the release notes, will now preserve the scroll position when switching between editors. Previously, navigating away from the Markdown Preview and then returning to it caused the scroll position to be reset.

### Warnings for missing Markdown preview styles

We now display a warning message if any of the stylesheets from `markdown.styles` used in the preview cannot be found.

### Markdown symbol search includes heading levels

You can quickly jump to a heading in a Markdown file using **Go to Symbol in File...** (`kb(workbench.action.gotoSymbol)`). This list now includes the heading level of each symbol, which allows you to quickly filter results by heading level.

![markdown symbols with header level](images/1_13/markdown-heading-levels.png)

---|-------|----------
`kb(list.focusFirstChild)`|Select first child of currently selected item's parent in tree/lists|`list.focusFirstChild`
