# August 2016 (version 1.5)

TBD

Here are the highlights:

* **Workbench**: TBD
* **Editor**: TBD
* **Languages**: TBD
* **Debugging**: TBD
* **Extension Authoring**: TBD

## Workbench

### File Icon Theme
<TBD>

## Editor

### Item


### Mac: Cmd+E no longer opens Quick Open

We decided to remove an (undocumented) key binding to bring up quick open for file search. You can bring back `kbstyle(Cmd+E)` with the following keybinding configuration:

```json
{ "key": "cmd+e", "command": "workbench.action.quickOpen" }
```

The reason behind this change is that `kbstyle(Cmd+E)` on Mac OS is typically associated with running a search in the current active file.

### Auto Save when application loses focus

You can now configure Auto Save (`files.autoSave` [setting](/docs/customization/userandworkspace.md)) with the new value `onWindowChange` to trigger save automatically when switching windows.

### Keep Quick Open visible even when focus is outside

We added a new setting `workbench.quickOpen.closeOnFocusLost` to control if Quick Open should close when focus moves out of the widget. By default, Quick Open will close, but you can set it to `false` to stay open even when focus is outside of VS Code.

### Include symbol results in file Quick Open results

We added a new setting `search.quickOpen.includeSymbols` to adjust if symbols should appear in file searches in Quick Open. Previously, we included symbol results in the general file picker but this had enough issues that we decided to make this optional. If you want the symbol results back, please set this option to `true`. Note that enabling this setting will make the overall file search speed slower depending on the time it needs for the global symbol search to return results.

>**Note:** You can always search for global symbols using the **Show All Symbols** (`kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)`) command.

### New actions to move Tabs left or right within a group

There are new actions to move a Tab (tabbed header) left or right within a group of editors.

The two actions and their default key bindings are:

Action | Command Palette | Key Binding
--- | --- | ---
`workbench.action.moveEditorLeftInGroup` | Move Editor Left | `kb(workbench.action.moveEditorLeftInGroup)`
`workbench.action.moveEditorRightInGroup` | Move Editor Right | `kb(workbench.action.moveEditorRightInGroup)`

### Closed editors reopen at their previous index

We always provided an action to reopen an editor after it was closed, `workbench.action.reopenClosedEditor` (`kb(workbench.action.reopenClosedEditor)`). With this release, editors will now reopen at the same index, preserving the order as before they were closed.

## Languages

### TypeScript

We bundle the officially released version of TypeScript with VisualStudio Code. For the September release this will be version version `1.8.1`. During September the version `2.0` will become available and you can already install the release candidate using `npm install -g typescript@rc`. Using a different version of TypeScript inside VisualStudio Code and on the command line or by a build tool is confusing, since you will get different errors. `2.0` supports features that are not yet supported in `1.8.1`. If you want to use the newer version of TypeScript inside Visual Studio code then please use the `typescript.tsdk` setting and refer to the corresponding [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript#_using-newer-typescript-versions).

VS Code now checks if the workspace folder contains a custom TypeScript version (typically installed via npm install typescript@x.x.x). If this is the case and the `typescript.tsdk` setting isn't used, then VS Code informs the user about the locally version and ask whether the local version should be used.

![TypeScript Version Check](images/1_5/ts-version-check.png)

The `More Information` action takes you to documentation for how to configure VS Code to always use a local installed TypeScript version. VS Code now also checks whether the used TypeScript language server is different than the globally installed `tsc` compiler. When this is the case, then a corresponding information message is shown.


### Settings to enable/disable Emmet for languages

You can now associate existing Emmet syntax profiles (such as `html`, `css`) with other languages with the new `emmet.syntaxProfiles` setting. The setting takes a language Id and associates it with an Emmet profile.

For example to use Emmet HTML abbreviations inside `JavaScript`:

```json
{
    "emmet.syntaxProfiles": {
        "javascript": "html"
     }
}
```
You can disable Emmet abbreviations for a particular language using the  `emmet.excludeLanguages` setting. The setting below disables Emmet in `php` files:

```json
    "emmet.excludeLanguages": [
        "php"
    ]
```

## Extensions

### Marketplace CDN

The [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) has been revamped
with a CDN, in order to improve download times and availability for extension queries and
downloads.

### Extension Contribution Details View

When browsing extensions in Code, there is now a **Contributions** section which will
display each extension's contributions, even before installing the extension.

![Extension Details](images/1_5/extension-details.png)

### Extension Sorting

You can now sort extensions not only by install count, in the extensions view:

![Extension sort](images/1_5/extension-sort.png)

Additionally, there is now a `extensions.autoUpdate` which, when set to `true`,
will let extension automatically update themselves without user intervention.

### Easier Updates

There is now an action to **update all outdated extensions**.

![Extension update all](images/1_5/extension-update-all.png)

Additionally, there is now a `extensions.autoUpdate` which, when set to `true`,
will let extension automatically update themselves without user intervention.

## Debugging

### Suggestions in Debug Console

As per a [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8114), the **Debug Console** now shows suggestions while typing. Currently this is only available for Node.js debugging, but will be available to other debuggers in the future.

![Debug Console Suggest](images/1_5/debug_repl_suggest.png)

### Multi-Line Debug Console Input

As per a [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8115), the **Debug Console** input now expands to multiple lines when needed. The expansion can be triggered using `kbstyle(Shift + Enter)`.

![Debug Console Multiline](images/1_5/debug_repl_multiline.png)

### Multi-Level Variable Paging

Data structures with a large number of children are displayed in multi-level chunks. This results in better performance and makes it easier to traverse a large number of children.

![Variable Multi Level Paging](images/1_5/debug_variable_paging.png)

## Node Debugging

### Launch debug target in Integrated Terminal

It is now possible to launch the Node.js debug target in the **Integrated Terminal** which helps when developing Node.js based command line applications that read from an interactive terminal and/or need to control their output on the terminal they are running in.

Since there are now three options where to run a node program (**Debug Console**, **Integrated Terminal**, external terminal), we've deprecated the boolean `launch.json` attribute `externalConsole` and introduced a new attribute `console` which accepts the following values: `internalConsole`, `integratedTerminal`, `externalTerminal`.

![New launch attribute Attribute console](images/1_5/debug-console-attribute.png)

Please note: Depending on what options you have configured for the `internalConsoleOptions` attribute, VS Code may decide to open the **Debug Console** which will hide the **Integrated Terminal**. To avoid this, please set `internalConsoleOptions` to `neverOpen`.

Please note: In this release, every debug session creates a new **Integrated Terminal**. In the next release, we will try to reuse an existing **Integrated Terminal** if possible.

## Extension Authoring

### Editor Commands

For the [VIM extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) to make good progress on their [roadmap](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) particularly on window scrolling and folding, we added the following editor APIs:

- **Scroll editor:** Scrolls the editor up or down - See [9609](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9609).

```javascript
commands.executeCommand('editorScroll', {to: 'up', by: 'page', value: '1'})
```

- **Reveal line:** Reveals the line at different logical positions in the editor - See [9609](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9609).

```javascript
commands.executeCommand('revealLine', {lineNumber: '10', at: 'top'})
```

- **Fold:** Fold the content of the editor `n` levels above or below the current cursor position.

```javascript
commands.executeCommand('editor.fold', {levels: '2', up: false})
```

- **Unfold:** Unfold the content of the editor `n` levels below the current cursor position.

```javascript
commands.executeCommand('editor.unfold', {levels: '2'})
```

### Powerful Completion Items

The [`Completion Item`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L2246) now supports additional text edits and an additional command.

With those, you can do rich things like:

* Add an import statement when completing a symbol.
* Add a library to the project when completing.

### Stable Input Box and Quick Open

When showing Quick Open or asking for input, you can provide the `ignoreFocusOut` option so that the dialogs will not close when focus moves to another part of VS Code or another window. Also, you can now programmatically close them using a cancellation token.

### New context menu keys

We added new context keys for more control over keybindings and menu items:

* `explorerResourceIsFolder` - Will reflect if a file or folder is selected in the Explorer.
* `resourceFilename`  - The name of the file currently active in the editor/Explorer.


### New Theme Settings

In this release, we exposed the following internal colors as TextMate theme settings and now theme writers can customize them with their themes.

- `rangeHighlight`: Background color of range highlighted, used by Quick Open and Find features.
- `selectionHighlight`: Background color of regions highlighted while selecting.
- `inactiveSelection`: Background color of selections when not in focus.
- `wordHighlight`: Background color of a symbol during read-access, like reading a variable.
- `wordHighlightStrong`: Background color of a symbol during write-access, like writing to a variable.
- `findMatchHighlight`: Background color of regions matching the search.
- `currentFindMatchHighlight`: Background color of the current region matching the search.
- `findRangeHighlight`: Background color of regions selected for search.
- `activeLinkForeground`: Color of active links.
- `hoverHighlight`: Background color when hovered.
- `referenceHighlight`: Background color of a reference when finding all references.
- `guide`: Color of the indentation guides which indicate nesting levels.

### Additions to the Debug Protocol

The [debug protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/master/protocol/src/debugProtocol.ts) has been extended in the following areas (and VS Code already provides the corresponding UI):

* **IntelliSense Support for the Debug Console**: Debug adapters can now implement the `completions` request to provide suggestion proposals for IntelliSense in the **Debug Console**. To enable this feature in VS Code, a debug adapter has to set the `supportsCompletionsRequest` capability to true.

* **Run in Terminal Request**: Debug adapters can now easily run the debug target in VS Code's **Integrated Terminal** via the `runInTerminal` request (which happens to be the first request that is called from the debug adapter into VS Code). The **Integrated Terminal** is an alternative to the **Debug Console** and better supports development of command line applications that read from an interactive terminal and/or need to control their output on the terminal they are running in. Before calling `runInTerminal` make sure that the front-end client supports it by verifying that the arguments passed to the `initialize` request have a `supportsRunInTerminalRequest` attribute and that its value is true.
