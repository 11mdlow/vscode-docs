## Editor

### Item

## Workbench

### Mac: Cmd+E no longer opens Quick Open

We decided to remove an (undocumented) key binding to bring up quick open for file search. You can bring back `kbstyle(Cmd+E)` with the following keybinding configuration:

```json
{ "key": "cmd+e", "command": "workbench.action.quickOpen" }
```

The reason behind this change is that `kbstyle(Cmd+E)` on Mac OS is typically associated with running a search in the current active file.

### Auto Save when application loses focus

You can now configure Auto Save (`files.autoSave` [setting](/docs/customization/userandworkspace.md)) with the new value `onWindowChange` to trigger save automatically when switching windows.

### Keep Quick Open visible even when focus is outside

We added a new setting `workbench.quickOpen.closeOnFocusLost` to control if Quick Open should close when focus moves out of the widget. By default, Quick Open will close, but you can set it to `false` to stay open even when focus is outside of VS Code.

### Include symbol results in file Quick Open results

We added a new setting `search.quickOpen.includeSymbols` to adjust if symbols should appear in file searches in Quick Open. Previously, we included symbol results in the general file picker but this had enough issues that we decided to make this optional. If you want the symbol results back, please set this option to `true`. Note that enabling this setting will make the overall file search speed slower depending on the time it needs for the global symbol search to return results.

>**Note:** You can always search for global symbols using the **Show All Symbols** (`kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)`) command.

### New actions to move Tabs left or right within a group

There are new actions to move a Tab (tabbed header) left or right within a group of editors.

The two actions and their default key bindings are:

Action | Command Palette | Key Binding
--- | --- | ---
`workbench.action.moveEditorLeftInGroup` | Move Editor Left | `kb(workbench.action.moveEditorLeftInGroup)`
`workbench.action.moveEditorRightInGroup` | Move Editor Right | `kb(workbench.action.moveEditorRightInGroup)`

### Closed editors reopen at their previous index

We always provided an action to reopen an editor after it was closed, `workbench.action.reopenClosedEditor` (`kb(workbench.action.reopenClosedEditor)`). With this release, editors will now reopen at the same index, preserving the order as before they were closed.

## Languages

## Debugging

### Suggestions in Debug Console

As per a [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8114), the Debug Console now shows suggestions while typing. Currently this is only available for Node.js debugging, but will be available to other debuggers in the future.

### Multi-Line Debug Console Input

As per a [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8115), the Debug Console input now expands to multiple lines when needed. The expansion can be triggered using `kbstyle(Shift + Enter)`.

### Multi-Level Variable Paging

Data structures with a large number of children are displayed in multi-level chunks. This results in better performance and makes it easier to traverse a large number of children.

## Extension Authoring

### Powerful Completion Items

The [`Completion Item`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L2246) now supports additional text edits and an additional command.

With those, you can do rich things like:

* Add an import statement when completing a symbol.
* Add a library to the project when completing.

### Stable Input Box and Quick Open

When showing Quick Open or asking for input, you can provide the `ignoreFocusOut` option so that the dialogs will not close when focus moves to another part of VS Code or another window. Also, you can now programmatically close them using a cancellation token.

### New context menu key to contribute actions to folders in the Explorer

We added a new context menu key `explorerResourceIsFolder` that enables an extension to contribute actions to folders in the File Explorer.

## Notable Changes

* [8983](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8983): Closing a dirty split editor (existing OR untitled) should not affect the initial editor
* [8499](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8499): Cannot distinguish different files with the same path.filename(x)
* [10360](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10360): File rename can close editors
* [9962](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9962): Explorer can freeze for large folders and many glob patterns

These are the [closed bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+milestone%3A%22August+2016%22+is%3Aclosed) and these are the [closed feature requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22August+2016%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afeature-request) for the 1.5 update.
