## Editor

## Workbench

### Mac: Cmd+E no longer opens quick open

We decided to remove an (undocumented) key binding to bring up quick open for file search. You can bring back `Cmd+E` with the following keybinding configuration: `{ "key": "cmd+e", "command": "workbench.action.quickOpen" }`

The reason behind this change is that `Cmd+E` on Mac OS is typically associated with running a search in the current active file.

### Auto save dirty files when application looses focus

You can now configure auto save with the new setting `onWindowChange` to trigger save automatically when switching windows.

### New setting to keep quick open visible even when focus is outside

We added a new setting `workbench.quickOpen.closeOnFocusLost` to control if quick open should close when focus moves out of the widget. By default quick open will close, but you can configure it to get a different behaviour and let it stay open even when focus is outside of VS Code.

### New setting to include symbol results in file quick open results

We added a new setting `search.quickOpen.includeSymbols` to adjust if symbols should appear in file searches in quick open. Previously we included symbol results in the general file picker but this had enough issues that we decided to make this optional. If you want the symbol results back, please set this option to `true`. Note that enabling this setting will make the overall file search speed slower depending on the time it needs for the global symbol search to return results.

Note: You can always search for global symbols using the `workbench.action.showAllSymbols` command. 

### New actions to move tabs left or right within a group

There are new actions that allow to move a tab left or right within a group of editors. You can assign keybindings to `workbench.action.moveEditorLeftInGroup ` and `workbench.action.moveEditorRightInGroup` to get quick access.

### Reopening closed editors reopens at the index where it was closed

We always provided an action to reopen a closed editor after it was closed (`workbench.action.reopenClosedEditor`). With this release, the editor will reopen at the same index it was closed previously. Thus, the order of editors can now be restored in the same way as it was before closing them.

## Extension Authoring

### New context key added to contribute actions to folders in the Explorer

We added a new context key `explorerResourceIsFolder` that enables an extension to contribute actions to folders in the files explorer.
