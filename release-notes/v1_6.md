### Node Debugging

#### Launch configuration supports 'npm' and other tools

A frequent feature request was to support running 'npm' scripts directly from a launch configuration.
This has now become possible by the following small tweaks of existing launch configuration concepts:
- Any program available on the PATH (e.g. 'npm', 'mocha', 'gulp', etc.) can now be used for the `runtimeExecutable` attribute and arguments can be passed via the `runtimeArgs`.
- The `program` attribute is no longer mandatory which helps if the npm script already specifies the program to launch.
- If you specify a debug port via the `port` attribute, the `--debug-brk=nnnn` attribute will no longer be automatically added because the debug port is typically specified by the npm scripts as well.

Let's look at an 'npm' example.
If your package.json has a 'debug' script, e.g.:
```json
  "scripts": {
    "debug": "node --nolazy --debug-brk=5858 myProgram.js"
  },
```

the corresponding launch config would look like this:
```json
{
	"name": "Launch via NPM",
	"type": "node",
	"request": "launch",
	"cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
	"runtimeExecutable": "npm",
	"runtimeArgs": [
		"run-script", "debug"
	],
	"port": 5858
}
```

#### Glob Pattern support for Source Map setup

When debugging transpiled code (e.g. TypeScript) and your build process generates the JavaScript code into a specific directory, it is necessary to help the node debugger finding this generated code. In previous version of VS Code this was done by specifying the root directory of the generated code via the `outDir` attribute.

In the September release it is now possible to use multiple glob patterns for including and excluding files from the set of generated JavaScript files. For this a new array typed attribute `outFiles` has been introduced. The old `outDir` is still supported, but we plan to deprecated this in the future.

The following example shows how to configure source maps if the generated code lives in an "out" and "node_modules" directory and you want to exclude the generated test code:
```json
  "sourceMaps": true,
  "outFiles": [
    "${workspaceRoot}/{out,node_modules}/**/*.js",
    "!${workspaceRoot}/out/tests/**/*.js"
  ]
```

## Extensions

## Extension Authoring

### Debug Extension Authoring

#### VS Code Debug Protocol

The VS Code debug protocol specification is now maintained as a [language neutral JSON schema](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/master/debugProtocol.json)
instead of a TypeScript definition file. This schema can be used to generate client or server libraries for a specific language automatically.
The project [vscode-debugadapter-node](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node) contains a [simple program](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/master/src/generator.ts)
to generate the TypeScript d.ts from the schema. This program can be used as a starting point for other languages.

#### External Terminal support for 'runInTerminal' request

Debug adapters can now easily run the debug target in an **External Terminal** via the `runInTerminal` request and passing a value `external` for the `kind` parameter. The **External Terminal** is an alternative to the **Integrated Terminal** and supports development of command line applications that read from an interactive terminal and/or need to control their output on the terminal they are running in. Before calling `runInTerminal` make sure that the front-end client supports it by verifying that the arguments passed to the `initialize` request have a `supportsRunInTerminalRequest` attribute and that its value is true.

#### Initial Configurations contributed by a command
It is now possible for a debug adapter to specify a command name as a value for 'initialConfigurations' in 'package.json'. The debug adapter extension can then register the specified command which will get called once 'launch.json' is generated for the first time. The command needs to return the inital content of the 'launch.json' file - this way debug adapters have more flexibility on customising the 'launch.json'. Our example mock debug illustrates this: ['initialConfigurations' contribution](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/master/package.json#L83) and [command registration](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/master/src/extension.ts#L29).

#### Debug Protocol Additions

Debug adapters can now implement 'hit count' support for breakpoints. With this a user can specify how many hits of a breakpoint to ignore before it 'breaks' the execution. The `SourceBreakpoint` and `FunctionBreakpoint` types now support an optional attribute `hitCondition` for passing a hit count expression to the debug adapter. To enable the UI for this feature in VS Code, a debug adapter has to set the `supportsHitConditionalBreakpoints` capability to true.

>**Note:** In the September release VS Code does not implement UI for editing the hit count condition.
