# September 2016 (version 1.6)

TBD

Here are some highlights:

* **Workbench**: TBD
* **Editor**: TBD
* **Languages**: TBD
* **Debugging**: TBD
* **Extensions**: TBD
* **Extension Authoring**: TBD

## Workbench

### Icons Everywhere

When using an File Icon Theme, we now show icons in many more places throughout the UI. This includes most trees that show files (for example, Problems panel, Search results, OPEN EDITORS section) as well as in **Quick Open** results and the editor headings.

A new setting `workbench.editor.showIcons` controls whether icons should show up for editors.

### Electron update

In this release, we decided to take a major update of the [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) framework. We now run with version 1.3.5 which brings big version increments to the Chrome rendering engine (from 49 to 52) and Node.js (from 5.10.0 to 6.3.0). This also means that all extensions can expect the full Node.js 6.3.0 runtime when running in this VS Code release. For a full list of changes in Node.js, please refer to https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

### New command to quickly switch windows

A new command **Switch Window** was added that opens a picker showing all the opened VS Code windows (instances) and provides a fast way to switch to a specific window right from VS Code.

### Image dimensions in Status Bar

When you open a binary file in VS Code, extra meta information is now displayed in the Status Bar. For all binary files, we show the size of the file and for images, we also show the image dimensions.

VS Code also now detects image file changes on disk so you no longer see stale old versions of an image.

### Automatic configuration of Auto Save and File Associations

We added support to make changes to the configuration files programmatically and this release uses this in several places in the workbench:

* You can now quickly enable auto save by selecting **Auto Save** from the **File** menu. This will write the auto save setting to your global configuration file.

* When changing the Language Mode of a file, you can now pick **Configure File Association for...** and your choice will be stored to the settings file and remembered. You no longer have to manually open the file and type the change in there.

## Editor

## Languages

## Debugging

### External Terminal now configurable

Running a debug target in an external terminal is now provided as a VS Code service to debugger extensions and we hope that this will result in widespread adoption. A useful side effect of this is that it is now possible to configure the terminal program to use via the existing `terminal.external.windowsExec`, `terminal.external.osxExec`, and `terminal.external.linuxExec` settings.

>**Note:** In this release, only the built-in debug extensions have adopted this new feature.

## Node Debugging

### Launch configuration supports 'npm' and other tools

A frequent feature request was to support running 'npm' scripts directly from a launch configuration. This is now possible by the following changes to the existing launch configuration concepts:

- Any program available on the PATH (e.g. 'npm', 'mocha', 'gulp', etc.) can now be used for the `runtimeExecutable` attribute and arguments can be passed via `runtimeArgs`.
- The `program` attribute is no longer mandatory which helps if the npm script already specifies the program to launch.
- If you specify a debug port via the `port` attribute, the `--debug-brk=nnnn` attribute will no longer be automatically added because the debug port is typically specified by the npm scripts as well.

Let's look at an 'npm' example. If your `package.json` has a 'debug' script, for example:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "debug": "node --nolazy --debug-brk=5858 myProgram.js"
  },
```

the corresponding launch configuration would look like this:

```json
{
	"name": "Launch via NPM",
	"type": "node",
	"request": "launch",
	"cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
	"runtimeExecutable": "npm",
	"runtimeArgs": [
		"run-script", "debug"
	],
	"port": 5858
}
```

### Glob Pattern support for Source Map setup

When debugging transpiled code (for example TypeScript) where your build process generates JavaScript code into a specific directory, it is necessary to help the Node.js debugger finding the generated code. In previous version of VS Code, this was done by specifying the root directory of the generated source code via the `outDir` attribute.

In the September release, it is now possible to use multiple glob patterns for including and excluding files from the set of generated JavaScript files. For this a new array typed attribute `outFiles` has been introduced. The old `outDir` is still supported, but we plan to deprecate this in the future.

The following example shows how to configure source maps if the generated code lives in an "out" and "node_modules" directory and you want to exclude the generated test code:

```json
{
  "sourceMaps": true,
  "outFiles": [
    "${workspaceRoot}/{out,node_modules}/**/*.js",
    "!${workspaceRoot}/out/tests/**/*.js"
  ]
}
```

### Experimental Node.js v6.3+ Debugger

We now have an experimental debug extension that uses the [V8 Inspector Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/debugger-protocol-viewer/v8/), which Node.js now exposes via the `--inspect` flag, only in Node.js versions 6.3+. This is the same protocol exposed by [Chrome and other targets](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/debugger-protocol). This extension runs on the [vscode-chrome-debug-core](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug-core) library which also powers the [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) extension, and several others.

>**Note** On Windows, the 6.x versions only support this in 32-bit versions of Node.js. The latest builds of v7 should work in 64 or 32-bit. See [this issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/8155).

This extension will eventually have feature-parity with vscode-node-debug, but isn't there yet. An overview is recorded [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-cdp-debug/issues/7) and you can see issues in the [vscode-node-debug2](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-cdp-debug/issues) repo and the [vscode-chrome-debug-core](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug-core/issues) repo. For the most part, you should be able to set `"type": "node2"` in your existing Node.js launch configuration and have things work the same, as long as it's running in Node.js v6.3+.

>**Note**: See troubleshooting tips in the extension [README](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.node-debug2).

## Extensions

## Extension Authoring

### Breaking Change: Button order in messages

When using any of the methods `showInformationMessage`, `showWarningMessage` , and `showErrorMessage`, you could always pass in a set of strings to show as actions next to the message. Previously, the order of messages was reversed such as the action you passed in first was shown last. We fixed this unexpected behavior in this release and actions are now displayed in order. Please check your extension for usage of this API to see if you are impacted. We think that the new behavior is more natural and thus did not add code that would keep the previous behavior.

### Breaking Change: Node.js update brings fs.realpath change

We updated to a newer Electron version with this release. Previously we shipped with Node.js 5.10.0 and now we are jumping to 6.3.0. Your extension will run with Node.js 6.3.0 and for a complete set of changes, please refer to https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

There is one breaking change in this update that can impact on your extension: `fs.realpath` (and `fs.realpathSync`) were reimplemented in Node.js 6.x and this brings behavioral changes on Windows. The table below describes the change.

Assume that on Windows you have a path of `C:\Path\to\file.txt`. Note how the drive letter is upper case and the first folder is also capital case (`Path`).

If you are using `fs.realpath` to normalize the path, here are the results depending on the Node.js version:

Action | Result in Node.js 5.x | Result in Node.js 6.x
--- | --- | ---
`fs.realpath('c:\path\to\file.txt')` | `c:\path\to\file.txt` | `C:\Path\to\file.txt`
`fs.realpath('C:\path\to\file.txt')` | `C:\path\to\file.txt` | `C:\Path\to\file.txt`

As you can see, Node.js 5.x preserves the path that is being passed in and does no conversion of casing. In Node.js 6.3.0, the casing of the path is returned as it is reported by Windows, thus you see an uppercase drive letter and the real casing of the first folder (`Path`).

If you are making assumptions about paths in your extension and do path comparisons, please keep this semantic change in mind. We encourage you to test your extension on Windows to see if you run into issues.

## Debug Extension Authoring

### VS Code Debug Protocol

The VS Code debug protocol specification is now maintained as a [language neutral JSON schema](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/master/debugProtocol.json) instead of a TypeScript definition file. This schema can be used to generate client or server libraries for a specific language automatically. The project [vscode-debugadapter-node](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node) contains a [simple program](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/master/src/generator.ts) to generate the TypeScript `d.ts` from the schema. This program can be used as a starting point for other languages.

### Debug Protocol server library upgraded to TypeScript 2.0.2

The server library [vscode-debugadapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-debugadapter) for the VS Code debug protocol has been upgraded to TypeScript 2.0.2 and its new '@types' feature.

If you are not ready to upgrade your debug extension to TypeScript 2.x, you can continue to use the previous version of the library by setting your dependencies in `package.json` to the 1.12 version:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "vscode-debugprotocol": "1.12.*",
    "vscode-debugadapter": "1.12.*"
    ...
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vscode-debugadapter-testsupport": "1.12.*",
    ...
  },
```

### External Terminal support for 'runInTerminal' request

Debug adapters can now easily run the debug target in an **External Terminal** via the `runInTerminal` request and passing a value `external` for the `kind` parameter. The **External Terminal** is an alternative to the **Integrated Terminal** and supports development of command line applications that read from an interactive terminal and/or need to control their output on the terminal they are running in. Before calling `runInTerminal` make sure that the front-end client supports it by verifying that the arguments passed to the `initialize` request have a `supportsRunInTerminalRequest` attribute and that its value is true.

### Initial Configurations contributed by a command

It is now possible for a debug adapter to specify a command name as a value for `initialConfigurations` attribute of the `debuggers` contribution in the `package.json` file. The debug adapter extension can then register the specified command which will get called once the `launch.json` file is generated for the first time. The command needs to return the initial content of the `launch.json` file - this way debug adapters have more flexibility on customizing `launch.json`. Our example mock debug illustrates this: ['initialConfigurations' contribution](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/master/package.json#L83) and [command registration](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/master/src/extension.ts#L29).

### Debug Protocol Additions

Debug adapters can now implement 'hit count' support for breakpoints. With this, a user can specify how many hits of a breakpoint to ignore before it 'breaks' the execution. The `SourceBreakpoint` and `FunctionBreakpoint` types now support an optional attribute `hitCondition` for passing a hit count expression to the debug adapter. To enable the UI for this feature in VS Code, a debug adapter has to set the `supportsHitConditionalBreakpoints` capability to true.

>**Note:** In the September release, VS Code does not implement UI for editing the hit count condition.
