## Debugging

### External Terminal now configurable

Running a debug target in an external terminal is now provided as a VS Code service to debugger extensions and we hope that this will result in widespread adoption.
A benevolent side effect of this is that it is now possible to configure the terminal program to use via the existing `terminal.external.windowsExec`, `terminal.external.osxExec`, and `terminal.external.linuxExec` settings.

>**Note:** in this release only the builtin debug extensions have adopted this new feature.

### Node Debugging

#### Launch configuration supports 'npm' and other tools

A frequent feature request was to support running 'npm' scripts directly from a launch configuration.
This has now become possible by the following small tweaks of existing launch configuration concepts:
- Any program available on the PATH (e.g. 'npm', 'mocha', 'gulp', etc.) can now be used for the `runtimeExecutable` attribute and arguments can be passed via the `runtimeArgs`.
- The `program` attribute is no longer mandatory which helps if the npm script already specifies the program to launch.
- If you specify a debug port via the `port` attribute, the `--debug-brk=nnnn` attribute will no longer be automatically added because the debug port is typically specified by the npm scripts as well.

Let's look at an 'npm' example.
If your package.json has a 'debug' script, e.g.:
```json
  "scripts": {
    "debug": "node --nolazy --debug-brk=5858 myProgram.js"
  },
```

the corresponding launch config would look like this:
```json
{
	"name": "Launch via NPM",
	"type": "node",
	"request": "launch",
	"cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
	"runtimeExecutable": "npm",
	"runtimeArgs": [
		"run-script", "debug"
	],
	"port": 5858
}
```

#### Glob Pattern support for Source Map setup

When debugging transpiled code (e.g. TypeScript) and your build process generates the JavaScript code into a specific directory, it is necessary to help the node debugger finding this generated code. In previous version of VS Code this was done by specifying the root directory of the generated code via the `outDir` attribute.

In the September release it is now possible to use multiple glob patterns for including and excluding files from the set of generated JavaScript files. For this a new array typed attribute `outFiles` has been introduced. The old `outDir` is still supported, but we plan to deprecated this in the future.

The following example shows how to configure source maps if the generated code lives in an "out" and "node_modules" directory and you want to exclude the generated test code:
```json
  "sourceMaps": true,
  "outFiles": [
    "${workspaceRoot}/{out,node_modules}/**/*.js",
    "!${workspaceRoot}/out/tests/**/*.js"
  ]
```

#### Experimental Node v6.3+ Debugger

We now have an experimental debug extension that uses the [V8 Inspector Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/debugger-protocol-viewer/v8/), which Node now exposes via the `--inspect` flag, only in Node versions 6.3+. This is the same protocol exposed by [Chrome and other targets](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/debugger-protocol). This extension runs on the [vscode-chrome-debug-core](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug-core) library which also powers the [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) extension, and several others.

>**Note** On Windows, the 6.x versions only support this in 32-bit versions of Node. The latest builds of v7 should work in 64 or 32-bit. See [this issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/8155).

This extension will eventually have feature-parity with vscode-node-debug, but isn't there yet. An overview is recorded [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-cdp-debug/issues/7) and you can see issues in the [vscode-node-debug2](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-cdp-debug/issues) repo and the [vscode-chrome-debug-core](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug-core/issues) repo. For the most part, you should be able to set `"type": "node2"` in your existing Node launch config and have things work the same, as long as it's running in Node v6.3+.

>**Note**: See troubleshooting tips in the extension [README](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.node-debug2).

## Extensions

## Extension Authoring

### Debug Extension Authoring

#### VS Code Debug Protocol

The VS Code debug protocol specification is now maintained as a [language neutral JSON schema](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/master/debugProtocol.json)
instead of a TypeScript definition file. This schema can be used to generate client or server libraries for a specific language automatically.
The project [vscode-debugadapter-node](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node) contains a [simple program](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/master/src/generator.ts)
to generate the TypeScript d.ts from the schema. This program can be used as a starting point for other languages.

#### Debug Protocol server library upgraded to TypeScript 2.0.2

The server library [vscode-debugadapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-debugadapter) for the VS Code debug protocol has been upgraded to TypeScript 2.0.2 and its new '@types' feature.

If you are not ready to upgrade your debug extension to TypeScript 2.x you can continue to use the previous version of the library by setting your dependencies in the package.json to the 1.12 version:
```json
  "dependencies": {
    "vscode-debugprotocol": "1.12.*",
    "vscode-debugadapter": "1.12.*"
    ...
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vscode-debugadapter-testsupport": "1.12.*",
    ...
  },
```

#### External Terminal support for 'runInTerminal' request

Debug adapters can now easily run the debug target in an **External Terminal** via the `runInTerminal` request and passing a value `external` for the `kind` parameter. The **External Terminal** is an alternative to the **Integrated Terminal** and supports development of command line applications that read from an interactive terminal and/or need to control their output on the terminal they are running in. Before calling `runInTerminal` make sure that the front-end client supports it by verifying that the arguments passed to the `initialize` request have a `supportsRunInTerminalRequest` attribute and that its value is true.

#### Initial Configurations contributed by a command
It is now possible for a debug adapter to specify a command name as a value for `initialConfigurations` attribute of the `debuggers` contribution in the 'package.json'. The debug adapter extension can then register the specified command which will get called once 'launch.json' is generated for the first time. The command needs to return the inital content of the 'launch.json' file - this way debug adapters have more flexibility on customising the 'launch.json'. Our example mock debug illustrates this: ['initialConfigurations' contribution](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/master/package.json#L83) and [command registration](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/master/src/extension.ts#L29).

#### Debug Protocol Additions

Debug adapters can now implement 'hit count' support for breakpoints. With this a user can specify how many hits of a breakpoint to ignore before it 'breaks' the execution. The `SourceBreakpoint` and `FunctionBreakpoint` types now support an optional attribute `hitCondition` for passing a hit count expression to the debug adapter. To enable the UI for this feature in VS Code, a debug adapter has to set the `supportsHitConditionalBreakpoints` capability to true.

>**Note:** In the September release VS Code does not implement UI for editing the hit count condition.
