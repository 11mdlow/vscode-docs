### Multi Root Workspaces

We continued working on support for opening multiple folders in a single VS Code window (instance) ([issue #396](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/396)). There was a preview of this feature in our last release (see [1.14.0 release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_preview-multi-root-workspaces)). Multi-root functionality is still only available in the Insiders build until we are confident enough that we can make it available in Stable. Before making multi-root available in Stable, we would like to complete:

* Full SCM support in multi-root scenarios.
* Full debug and tasks support.
* Convert all extensions that we ship to the multi-root APIs.

To try it out, grab our Insiders build from [https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

During this sprint, we focused on making multi-root workspaces a first class concept as well as broadening support for multi-root folders in various areas (SCM, extensions, tasks and debug).

#### Problems with the initial solution

The solution we presented at the end of our 1.14 milestone was to introduce a new setting to associate additional folders with a root folder. Whenever you opened the root folder, the additional folders would also show up:

```json
{
  "path to folder": [
      "additionalFolder1",
      "additionalFolder2"
   ]
}
```

While this solution allowed us to make good progress without introducing new concepts to VS Code, it came with enough flaws that we decided to revisit this approach. Some problems were:

* The root folder where the setting is defined becomes a defacto "master" folder, but not all multi-root scenarios have a master-details relationship.
* You could no longer open the master folder as a single-folder workspace.
* You could not remove the master folder in a workspace.
* You could not open multiple folders at once as VS Code wouldn't know which folder was the master.
* There was confusion as some of the master folder's workspace settings applied to all other foldersg.
* Your settings file now contains multi-root workspace configurations.
* It was unclear how to share this setup wih other people.

For these reasons, we stopped using settings to define master-details folder relationships and instead introduced "Workspaces".

#### Workspace

A Workspace is a new concept that surfaces in the UI whenever you want to have multiple folders opened in a single window (instance). A workspace is a simple configuration file that describes the folders you want to have open in a window. For example, for VS Code development we typically use three folders very frequently:

![Workspace File](images/1_15/workspace.png)

As you can see from the screenshot above, the workspace configuration file also contains a section for settings. Any **Workspace Setting** that you configure will end up in this file too (see below for more details around Workspace Settings).

Once you add additional folders to an empty window or a single-folder window, we make this window into an "Untitled Workspace". A window reload is currently required for this transition (see video below). In the future, we think that we can make this transition even smoother without a window reload.

![Workspaces](images/1_15/workspace.gif)

#### Untitled Workspace

As long as you do not save a workspace, it will appear as an "Untitled Workspace". We do not force you to save a workspace until you want to have it in a permanent location, for example, on your Desktop. Untitled workspaces are present as long as the window they are using is open. Once you close a window with an untitled workspace, we will ask you to save it if you plan to open it again in the future:

![Save Workspace](images/1_15/save_workspace.png)

#### Saved Workspaces

Saved Workspaces can be opened by double clicking the `.code-workspace` file or via the new **Open Workspace...** command under the **File** menu:

![Open Workspace](images/1_15/open_workspace.png)

You will also see a new action **Save Workspace As...** that allows you to save the workspace to any location on your disk. The file extension of a VS Code workspace is `.code-workspace` and in the future, we plan to make it easier to share these files by allowing relative paths for folders.

Workspaces show up in a similar way as folders. You can open them from the list of recently opened workspaces:

![Recently Opened Workspace](images/1_15/recent_workspace.png)

Any workspace will have an extra `(Workspace)` suffix appended to the name.

#### Settings

TODO@Sandy

#### Icon for Root Folders

Icon theme authors, please get ready for multi-root support: We added two new icon categories for VS Code: `rootFolder` and `rootFolderExpanded` that can be used to show root folders in a different way compared to other folders. For example, the File Explorer will use this icon as well as the list of recently opened workspaces.

### New setting to close window when last editor closes

There is a new setting `window.closeWhenEmpty` to control if the window (instance) should close when the last editor is closed. On macOS, it is typical application behavior that the instance should close when the last document is closed. If you want this behavior, you can enable the setting.

**Note**: The setting only has an impact for windows that have no folders opened.

### Improved --wait support

VS Code can be configured as the editor for external programs such as Git (see our [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-patchdiff-mode) ). For that purpose, the `--wait` command line argument is used to keep the VS Code instance open until the external program is closed. In this release, we re-implemented this feature to work around some known issues.

First of all, we will now remember which instance was opened with `--wait` and properly wait for that instance to close. This fixes annoying issues when `--wait` is used while VS Code is already running as well as when you open a first instance and then more windows afterwards without closing the first window. In addition, on macOS where closing a window typically does not quit the application, we are now also returning control to the process that started the instance once it gets closed.

Second, when you close the last editor of the instance that was opened with `--wait`, we will now close the window automatically. With that, you can just hit `kb(workbench.action.closeActiveEditor)` to close the window.

**Note**: If you always want to close the window when the last editor closes, check out the new `window.closeWhenEmpty` setting for empty windows.

### New theme color for title bar border

If you are on macOS, we show a custom title bar at the top. A new color `titleBar.border` can now be defined in themes or settings to draw a border separating the title bar from the rest of the editor.

### New setting to control Explorer sorting

Thanks to [Dmitry Zabello (@foreverest)](https://github.com/foreverest), a new setting `explorer.sortOrder` configures how files and folders are sorted in the File Explorer. You can choose between;

* `filesFirst` - Sort files before folders
* `mixed` - Sort files and folders without separation
* `modified` - Sort by last modified time
* `type` - Sort by file type

This is how the Explorer looks like with `explorer.sortOrder: mixed`

![Explorer Sorting](images/1_15/explorer-sorting.png)

### Quick Open command with prefix

The existing command `workbench.action.quickOpen` can now receive a prefix as an argument to open the **Quick Open** picker with any text prefilled.

For example, you can configure a keybinding to bring up **Quick Open** with text prefilled like this:

```json
{ "key": "cmd+o", "command": "workbench.action.quickOpen", "args": "my-prefix" }
```

As an extension author, you can programmatically execute the command and pass in arguments:

```typescript
vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.quickOpen', 'my-prefix');
```

Thanks to [cristianhosu (@cristianhosu)](https://github.com/cristianhosu) for helping out with this.

### Compare dirty file with version on disk

Thanks to [Tobias Friemel (@tfriem)](https://github.com/tfriem), a new action compares a dirty (unsaved) file to its version on disk to quickly see the recent changes:

![Compare with Saved](images/1_15/compare-with-saved.png)

You can find the action from the context menu of dirty files within the **OPEN EDITORS** view of the Explorer and also as global command **Files: Compare Active File with Saved** (`kb(workbench.files.action.compareWithSaved)`).

### New setting to control font aliasing (macOS only)

A new setting `workbench.fontAliasing` was added (macOS) to control the font smoothing within the workbench and editor. By default, fonts are subpixel anti-aliased. Change the setting to `antialiased` to smooth the font on the level of the pixel, as opposed to the subpixel (this can make the font appear lighter overall). You can disable font smoothing if you set it to `none` (text will show with jagged sharp edges).

### Remove entries from recently opened

A new action (X) now shows up next to each entry of the recently opened picker (`kb(workbench.action.openRecent)`) to remove that entry from the list.

### Managing views

After supporting custom views in the Explorer, there was a need to to customise their appearance. With this release, you can now change the order and the visibility of the views in

- Explorer View
- Debug View
- Extensions View

![Views management](images/1_15/views_management.gif)

### Search in webviews

A PR from [Cody Hoover (@hoovercj)](https://github.com/hoovercj) brings search to webview contents, including the Release Notes, Markdown preview, and extension README pages:

## Editor

### Large File Support

Large files are always a great way to stress-test an editor. We currently use a line based representation of the text buffer, which has some serious advantages, but also disadvantages, especially in terms of memory consumption (e.g. a file with very many short lines).

Any file that is over 30MB or over 300K lines will be considered a large file and handled in certain code paths, specially. By choosing to disable certain features for such files, e.g. tokenization, line guides, wrapping or folding, we were able to optimize the memory usage, in some cases, by as much as 50%.

Additionally, large files will never travel to our web worker, which computes diff information, link detection, or word based completions. This helps in reducing the memory pressure on the OS.

Some of the optimizations will impact all files, although the effects will be hard to notice with small files. We have decided to lift the hard coded file size limit of 50MB on 64-bit installations and enforce a 300MB file size limit of 32-bit installations.

### Support for snippet choices

With snippet choices, a placeholder can be prefilled with a set of values. The syntax is `${<number>|option_1,...,option_n|}`.

Below is a working sample specifying a fixed set of color choices:

```json
"color": {
	"prefix": "color",
	"body": "> Pick your favorite color ${1|red,green,blue,pink|}.\n< He likes $1."
}
```

### Snippets preview

When inserting snippets via IntelliSense, a preview is now shown.

### Prettier diff results

With this release, we have made some tweaks to our diff algorithm to adjust the differences (which are found with the help of a Longest-Common-Substring algorithm) in such a way that they are more pleasing to the human eye.

In some cases, this means we will be more aligned with the output of git diff (which also incorporates some of these heuristics), but in other cases (like when only trim whitespace has changed), our result will no longer contain the LCS, so it will be different than git diff, but in our opinion it will also be more pleasing.

## Extension Authoring

### New API to open an editor or diff editor with a specific selection

We enriched the existing `TextDocumentShowOptions` with a new property `selection: Range` that can be used from the `showTextDocument` method as well as the `vscode.diff` command. When provided, the editor will reveal and select the provided range.

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.files.action.compareWithSaved)`|Compare a dirty file with the version on disk|`workbench.files.action.compareWithSaved`
