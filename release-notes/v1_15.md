## Workbench

### Multi Root Workspaces

We continued working on the support for opening multiple folders into a single VS Code window ([issue #396](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/396)). You already saw a preview of this feature for our last release (see [1.14.0 release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_preview-multi-root-workspaces)). Multi root functionality is still only available from our insiders build until we are confident enough that we can make it available in stable. Part of the criteria for making multi root available in stable is:
* full SCM support in multi-root scenarios
* full debug and tasks support
* all the extensions we ship with have adopted multi-root APIs

To try it out, grab our Insiders build from [https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

During this sprint we focussed on making multi-root workspaces a first class concept as well as broadening support for multi-root in various areas (SCM, extensions, tasks and debug).

#### Flaws of the old solution

The solution we presented at the end of our 1.14 sprint was to introduce a new setting that allows to associate additional folders with a root folder. Whenever you opened the root folder, the additional folders would also show up:

```json
{
  "path to folder": [
      "additionalFolder1",
      "additionalFolder2"
   ]
}
```

While this solution allowed us to make good progress without introudcing new concepts to VS Code, it comes with enough flaws that we decided to revisit this approach. Examples are:
* the root folder for which the setting is defined becomes kind of a "master" folder, but not all multi-root scenarios come with a master-details relationship
* you could not open the master folder as a single-folder workspace anymore
* you could not remove the master folder in a workspace
* you could not open multiple folders at once (because which master folder to pick in that case?)
* some of the master folder's workspace settings applied to all other folders, which is confusing
* your setting file gets polluted with multi-root workspace configurations
* how to share this setup to other people?

For these reasons we removed the concept of settings for a master-details folder relationship and introduce: Workspaces.

#### Workspaces

Workspaces is a new concept that surfaces in the UI whenever you deal with having multiple folders opened in a single window. A workspace is a simple configuration file that describes the folders you want to have opened in a window. For example for VS Code we typically use three folders very frequently:

![Workspace File](images/1_15/workspace.png)

As you can see from the screenshot, the workspace configuration file also contains a section for settings: Any workspace setting that you configure will end up in this file too (see below for more details around Workspace Settings). 

Once you add additional folders to an empty window or a single-folder window, we make this window into a "Untitled Workspace". A window reload is currently required for this transition (see video below). In the future we think that we can make this transition even smoother without a window reload.

![Workspaces](images/1_15/workspace.gif)

#### Untitled Workspaces

As long as you do not save a workspace it will appear as an "Untitled Workspace". We do not force you to save a workspace until you want to have it in a permanent location, e.g. on your desktop. Untitled workspaces are present as long as the window they are using is opened. Once you close a window with an untitled workspace we will ask you to save it if you plan to open it again in the future:

![Save Workspace](images/1_15/save_workspace.png)

#### Saved Workspaces

Saved Workspaces can be opened by double clicking them or via the new "Open Workspace" action under the file menu:

![Open Workspace](images/1_15/open_workspace.png)

You will also see a new action "Save Workspace As..." that allows you to save the workspace to any location on your disk. The file extension of a VS Code workspace is `.code-workspace` and in the future we plan to make it easier to share these files by allowing to use relative paths for folders.

Workspaces show up in a similar way as folders: You can open them from the list of recently opened workspaces:

![Recently Opened Workspace](images/1_15/recent_workspace.png)

Any workspace will have an extra `(Workspace)` appended to the name.

#### Settings
TODO@Sandy

#### Icon for Root Folders

Icon theme authors, please get ready for multi root support: We added two new icon categories for VSCode: `rootFolder` and `rootFolderExpanded` that can be used to show root folders in a different way compared to other folders. For example, the files explorer will use this icon as well as the list of recently opened workspaces.

### New setting to close window when last editor closes

There is a new setting `window.closeWhenEmpty` to control if the window (instance) should close when the last editor is closed. On macOS, it is typical application behavior that the instance should close when the last document is closed. If you want this behavior, you can enable the setting.

**Note**: The setting only has an impact for windows that have no folders opened.

### Improved --wait support

VS Code can be configured as the editor for external programs such as Git (see our [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-patchdiff-mode) ). For that purpose, the `--wait` command line argument is used to keep the VS Code instance open until the external program is closed. In this release, we re-implemented this feature to work around some known issues.

First of all, we will now remember which instance was opened with `--wait` and properly wait for that instance to close. This fixes annoying issues when `--wait` is used while VS Code is already running as well as when you open a first instance and then more windows afterwards without closing the first window. In addition, on macOS where closing a window typically does not quit the application, we are now also returning control to the process that started the instance once it gets closed.

Second, when you close the last editor of the instance that was opened with `--wait`, we will now close the window automatically. With that, you can just hit `kb(workbench.action.closeActiveEditor)` to close the window.

**Note**: If you always want to close the window when the last editor closes, check out the new `window.closeWhenEmpty` setting for empty windows.

### New theme color for title bar border

If you are on macOS, we show a custom title bar at the top. A new color `titleBar.border` can now be defined in themes or settings to draw a border separating the title bar from the rest of the editor.

### New setting to control Explorer sorting

Thanks to [Dmitry Zabello (@foreverest)](https://github.com/foreverest), a new setting `explorer.sortOrder` configures how files and folders are sorted in the File Explorer. You can choose between;

* `filesFirst` - Sort files before folders
* `mixed` - Sort files and folders without separation
* `modified` - Sort by last modified time
* `type` - Sort by file type

This is how the Explorer looks like with `explorer.sortOrder: mixed`

### Quick Open command with prefix

The existing command `workbench.action.quickOpen` can now receive a prefix as an argument to open the **Quick Open** picker with any text prefilled.

For example, you can configure a keybinding to bring up **Quick Open** with text prefilled like this:

```json
{ "key": "cmd+o", "command": "workbench.action.quickOpen", "args": "my-prefix" }
```

As an extension author, you can programmatically execute the command and pass in arguments:

```typescript
vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.quickOpen', 'my-prefix');
```

Thanks to [cristianhosu (@cristianhosu)](https://github.com/cristianhosu) for helping out with this.

### Compare dirty file with version on disk

Thanks to [Tobias Friemel (@tfriem)](https://github.com/tfriem), a new action compares a dirty (unsaved) file to its version on disk to quickly see the recent changes:

![Compare with Saved](images/1_15/compare-with-saved.png)

You can find the action from the context menu of dirty files within the **OPEN EDITORS** view of the Explorer and also as global command **Files: Compare Active File with Saved** (`kb(workbench.files.action.compareWithSaved)`).

### New setting to control font aliasing (macOS only)

A new setting `workbench.fontAliasing` was added (macOS) to control the font smoothing within the workbench and editor. By default, fonts are subpixel antialiased. Change the setting to `antialiased` to smooth the font on the level of the pixel, as opposed to the subpixel (this can make the font appear lighter overall). You can disable font smoothing if you set it to `none` (text will show with jagged sharp edges).

### Remove Entries from Recently Opened

A new action now shows up next to each entry of the recently opened picker (`kb(workbench.action.openRecent)`) to remove that entry from the list.

### Search in webviews

A PR from [Cody Hoover (@hoovercj)](https://github.com/hoovercj) brings search to webview contents, including the markdown preview, release notes, and extension README pages:

![Find in a webview](images/1_15/webview-find.gif)


## Editor

### Support for Snippet Choice 

With snippet choice a placeholder can be prefilled with a set of values. The synatx is `${<number>|option_1,...,option_n|}`, a working sample is:

```json
"color": {
	"prefix": "color",
	"body": "> Pick your favourite color ${1|red,green,blue,pink|}.\n< He likes $1."
}
```

### Snippets preview

When inserting snippets via IntelliSense a preview is now shown.

## Extension Authoring

### New API to open an editor or diff editor with a specific selection

We enriched the existing `TextDocumentShowOptions` with a new property `selection: Range` that can be used from the `showTextDocument` method as well as the `vscode.diff` command. When provided, the editor will reveal and select the provided range.

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.files.action.compareWithSaved)`|Compare a dirty file with the version on disk|`workbench.files.action.compareWithSaved`
