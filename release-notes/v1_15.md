Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.15 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[July Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30209)** - See what's planned for the milestone. 
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+milestone%3A%22July+2017%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs in the July milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### New setting to close window when last editor closes

There is a new setting `window.closeWhenEmpty` to control if the window (instance) should close when the last editor is closed. On macOS, it is typical application behavior that the instance should close when the last document is closed. If you want this behavior, you can enable the setting.

**Note**: The setting only has an impact for windows that have no folders opened.

### Improved --wait support

VS Code can be configured as the editor for external programs such as Git (see our [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-patchdiff-mode) ). For that purpose, the `--wait` command line argument is used to keep the VS Code instance open until the external program is closed. In this release, we re-implemented this feature to work around some known issues.

First of all, we will now remember which instance was opened with `--wait` and properly wait for that instance to close. This fixes annoying issues when `--wait` is used while VS Code is already running as well as when you open a first instance and then more windows afterwards without closing the first window. In addition, on macOS where closing a window typically does not quit the application, we are now also returning control to the process that started the instance once it gets closed.

Second, when you close the last editor of the instance that was opened with `--wait`, we will now close the window automatically. With that, you can just hit `kb(workbench.action.closeActiveEditor)` to close the window.

**Note**: If you always want to close the window when the last editor closes, check out the new `window.closeWhenEmpty` setting for empty windows.

### New theme color for title bar border

If you are on macOS, we show a custom title bar at the top. A new color `titleBar.border` can now be defined in themes or settings to draw a border separating the title bar from the rest of the editor.

### New setting to control Explorer sorting

Thanks to [Dmitry Zabello (@foreverest)](https://github.com/foreverest), a new setting `explorer.sortOrder` configures how files and folders are sorted in the File Explorer. You can choose between;

* `filesFirst` - Sort files before folders
* `mixed` - Sort files and folders without separation
* `modified` - Sort by last modified time
* `type` - Sort by file type

This is how the Explorer looks like with `explorer.sortOrder: mixed`

### Quick Open command with prefix

The existing command `workbench.action.quickOpen` can now receive a prefix as an argument to open the **Quick Open** picker with any text prefilled.

For example, you can configure a keybinding to bring up **Quick Open** with text prefilled like this:

```json
{ "key": "cmd+o", "command": "workbench.action.quickOpen", "args": "my-prefix" }
```

As an extension author, you can programmatically execute the command and pass in arguments:

```typescript
vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.quickOpen', 'my-prefix');
```

Thanks to [cristianhosu (@cristianhosu)](https://github.com/cristianhosu) for helping out with this.

### Compare dirty file with version on disk

Thanks to [Tobias Friemel (@tfriem)](https://github.com/tfriem), a new action compares a dirty (unsaved) file to its version on disk to quickly see the recent changes:

![Compare with Saved](images/1_15/compare-with-saved.png)

You can find the action from the context menu of dirty files within the **OPEN EDITORS** view of the Explorer and also as global command **Files: Compare Active File with Saved** (`kb(workbench.files.action.compareWithSaved)`).

## Extension Authoring

### New API to open an editor or diff editor with a specific selection

We enriched the existing `TextDocumentShowOptions` with a new property `selection: Range` that can be used from the `showTextDocument` method as well as the `vscode.diff` command. When provided, the editor will reveal and select the provided range.

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.files.action.compareWithSaved)`|Compare a dirty file with the version on disk|`workbench.files.action.compareWithSaved`
