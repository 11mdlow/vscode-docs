# February 2018 (version 1.21)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.21 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/43361)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/59?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the February milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### New Notifications UI

We updated the look and feel of notifications in VS Code. Notifications now :

* Slide in from the bottom right (unless the new Notification Center is opened).
* Can be dismissed and then reviewed later through the Notification Center.
* Can be expanded to show the full contents of the message.

Each notification has the following structure:

![Notification](images/1_21/notification.png)

If a notification does not provide any source information or any action buttons, it will show only a severity and message. These types of notifications will hide automatically after a certain timeout.

![Notification](images/1_21/notification-small.png)

A new entry ("bell" icon) in the bottom right of the Status Bar indicates the number of new notifications. Once clicked, the Notification Center will open that shows all notifications that were not dismissed yet.

Each notification can be managed with new commands and configurable keybindings (see below in the [New Commands](#new-commands) section).

**Note for extension and theme authors:** With the new notification UI, we introduced new theming colors for theme authors to adopt (see below). There is also a soft deprecation of the `isCloseAffordance` attribute for extension authors which is no longer needed when showing these style of notifications.

### Better drag and drop support

We revisited our support for drag and drop in the workbench and now support more drag and drop scenarios. Probably the most up-voted request was to drag files from one File Explorer to another VS Code instance:

![DND files across Windows](images/1_21/window-dnd-files.gif)

Other improvements are to the **OPEN EDITORS** view. You can now:

* Drag files from the Explorer into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.
* Drag files from the desktop into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.
* Drag tabs into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.

### Copy/Paste files across windows

We now allow you to copy and paste files between 2 VS Code File Explorers in different instances. This works for single or multi-selection of files as well as folders.

## Extension Authoring

### Add, remove and change workspace folders

The [previously proposed](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_20#_add-remove-and-change-workspace-folders) API for adding, removing and changing workspace folders has been promoted to Stable.

### Messages: `isCloseAffordance` no longer supported for non-modal messages

With the introduction of a new notification UI in this milestone, every notification message now provides a close button in the top-right corner. This change means that the close action is no longer mixed with other message actions and `isCloseAffordance` is no longer be needed for messages that are non-modal. Please look at your message usage and make sure that you are not adding an action to close the notification unless that action is doing something specific for your extension.

A message will still close automatically if any of the provided actions is clicked by the user.

### New notification colors and removal of old colors

With the new notifications UX, new colors were added that theme authors should adopt:

* `notificationsCenter.border`: Notification Center border color.
* `notificationsCenterHeader.foreground`: Notification Center header foreground color.
* `notificationsCenterHeader.background`: Notification Center header background color.
* `notificationsToast.border`: Notification toast border color.
* `notifications.foreground`: Notifications foreground color.
* `notifications.background`: Notifications background color.
* `notifications.border`: Notifications border color separating from other notifications in the Notification Center.
* `notificationLink.foreground`: Notification links foreground color.

All of the previously supported theme colors for notifications are no longer supported.

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(notifications.showList)`|Show the Notification Center|`notifications.showList`
`kb(notifications.hideList)`|Hide the Notification Center|`notifications.hideList`
`kb(notifications.toggleList)`|Toggle the visibility of the Notification Center|`notifications.toggleList`
`kb(notifications.hideToasts)`|Hide notification toasts|`notifications.hideToasts`
`kb(notifications.focusToasts)`|Focus first notification toast|`notifications.focusToasts`
`kb(notifications.focusNextToast)`|Focus next notification toast|`notifications.focusNextToast`
`kb(notifications.focusPreviousToast)`|Focus previous notification toast|`notifications.focusPreviousToast`
`kb(notifications.focusFirstToast)`|Focus first notification toast|`notifications.focusFirstToast`
`kb(notifications.focusLastToast)`|Focus last notification toast|`notifications.focusLastToast`
`kb(notification.collapse)`|Collapse notification if possible|`notification.collapse`

`kb(notification.toggle)`|Toggle expansion state of notification if possible|`notification.toggle`

With the new notification commands, there are also new contexts for keybindings:

* `notificationFocus`: when a notification has keyboard focus (either as toast or in the Notification Center)
* `notificationsCenterVisible`: when the Notification Center is visible
* `notificationsToastsVisible`: when a notification toast is visible

Note that notification toasts are never displayed when the notification Center is visible.
