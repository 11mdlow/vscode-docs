# February 2018 (version 1.21)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.21 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/43361)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/59?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the February milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### New Notifications UI

We revamped the look & feel of notifications in VS Code. The old design had a number of flaws that we wanted to address, specifically:
* they were always on top of the editor, hiding the tab bar and potentially some of the first lines of the file that is opened
* you could never hide notifications to get back to them later, this would remove them for good
* you could never expand a long notification to read its full message text

The new notifications:
* slide in from the bottom right (unless the new notification center is opened)
* can be dismissed and brought back through the notifications center later
* can be expanded to show the full contents of the message if needed

Each notification has the following structure:

![Notification](images/1_21/notification.png)

If a notification does not provide any source information or any buttons to act on, it will show only a severity and message. These notifications will hide automatically after a certain timeout.

![Notification](images/1_21/notification-small.png)

A new entry in the bottom right corner ("bell" icon) indicates the number of new notifications. Once clicked, the notification center will open that shows all notifications that were not dismissed yet.

Each notification can be managed with new commands and configurable keybindings (see below in the new commands section).

**Note for extension and theme authors:** With the new UX we introduce new theming colors for theme authors to adopt (see below). There is also a soft deprecation of the `isCloseAffordance` for extension authors which is no longer needed when showing these style of notifications.

### Better drag and drop support

We revisited our support for drag and drop in the workbench and now support more drag and drop scenarios. Probably the most up-voted request was to drag files from one File Explorer to another VS Code instance:

![DND files across Windows](images/1_21/window-dnd-files.gif)

Other improvements are to the **OPEN EDITORS** view. You can now:

* Drag files from the Explorer into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.
* Drag files from the desktop into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.
* Drag tabs into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.

### Copy/Paste files across windows

We now allow you to copy and paste files between 2 VS Code File Explorers in different instances. This works for single or multi-selection of files as well as folders.

## Extension Authoring

### Add, remove and change workspace folders

The [previously proposed](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_20#_add-remove-and-change-workspace-folders) API for adding, removing and changing workspace folders has been promoted to stable.

### Messages: `isCloseAffordance` no longer supported for non-modal messages

With the introduction of a new notification UX in this milestone, every notification message now provides a close button in the top-right corner. That way, the close action is no longer mixed with other actions of the message that are more important.

As such, `isCloseAffordance` will no longer be needed for messages that are non-modal. Please take a look at your usage and make sure that you are not adding an action to close the notification unless this action is doing something specific for your extension.

A message will still close automatically if any of the provided actions is clicked by the user.

### New theme colors and removal of old colors

With the new notifications UX, some new colors were added for theme authors to adopt:

- `notificationsCenter.border`: Notifications center border color.
- `notificationsCenterHeader.foreground`: Notifications center header foreground color.
- `notificationsCenterHeader.background`: Notifications center header background color.
- `notificationsToast.border`: Notification toast border color.
- `notifications.foreground`: Notifications foreground color.
- `notifications.background`: Notifications background color.
- `notifications.border`: Notifications border color separating from other notifications in the notifications center.
- `notificationLink.foreground`: Notification links foreground color.

Since notifications are now displayed in a different way, all of the previously supported theme colors for notifications are no longer supported.

These additional colors were also added

- `terminal.border`: The color of the border that separates split panes within the terminal. This defaults to panel.border.

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(notifications.showList)`|Show the notifications center|`notifications.showList`
`kb(notifications.hideList)`|Hide the notifications center|`notifications.hideList`
`kb(notifications.toggleList)`|Toggle the visibility of the notifications center|`notifications.toggleList`
`kb(notifications.hideToasts)`|Hide notification toasts|`notifications.hideToasts`
`kb(notifications.focusToasts)`|Focus first notification toast|`notifications.focusToasts`
`kb(notifications.focusNextToast)`|Focus next notification toast|`notifications.focusNextToast`
`kb(notifications.focusPreviousToast)`|Focus previous notification toast|`notifications.focusPreviousToast`
`kb(notifications.focusFirstToast)`|Focus first notification toast|`notifications.focusFirstToast`
`kb(notifications.focusLastToast)`|Focus last notification toast|`notifications.focusLastToast`
`kb(notification.collapse)`|Collapse notification if possible|`notification.collapse`
`kb(notification.expand)`|Expand notification if possible|`notification.expand`
`kb(notification.toggle)`|Toggle expansion state of notification if possible|`notification.toggle`
`kb(notification.clear)`|Clear notification|`notification.clear`
`kb(notifications.clearAll)`|Clear all notifications|`notifications.clearAll`

With the new notification commands, there are also new contexts for keybindings:
- `notificationFocus`: when a notification has keyboard focus (either as toast or in the notification center)
- `notificationsCenterVisible`: when the notification center is visible
- `notificationsToastsVisible`: when a notification toast is visible

Note that notification toasts are never showing when the notification center is visible.
