# February 2018 (version 1.21)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.21 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/43361)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/59?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the February milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Better drag and drop support

We revisited our support for drag and drop in the workbench and now support more drag and drop scenarios. Probably the most up-voted request was to drag files from one File Explorer to another VS Code instance:

Other improvements are to the **OPEN EDITORS** view. You can now:

* Drag files from the Explorer into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.
* Drag files from the desktop into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.
* Drag tabs into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.

### Copy/Paste files across windows

We now allow you to copy and paste files between 2 VS Code File Explorers in different instances. This works for single or multi-selection of files as well as folders.

## Extension Authoring

### Add, remove and change workspace folders

The [previously proposed](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_20#_add-remove-and-change-workspace-folders) API for adding, removing and changing workspace folders has been promoted to stable.

## Messages: `isCloseAffordance` no longer supported for non-modal messages

With the introduction of a new notification UX in this milestone, every notification message now provides a close button in the top-right corner. That way, the close action is no longer mixed with other actions of the message that are more important.

As such, `isCloseAffordance` will no longer be needed for messages that are non-modal. Please take a look at your usage and make sure that you are not adding an action to close the notification unless this action is doing something specific for your extension.

A message will still close automatically if any of the provided actions is clicked by the user.

## New notification colors and removal of old colors

With the new notifications UX, some new colors were added for theme authors to adopt:

- `notificationsCenter.border`: Notifications center border color. Notifications slide in from the bottom right of the window.
- `notificationsCenterHeader.foreground`: Notifications center header foreground color. Notifications slide in from the bottom right of the window.
- `notificationsCenterHeader.background`: Notifications center header background color. Notifications slide in from the bottom right of the window.
- `notificationsToast.border`: Notification toast border color. Notifications slide in from the bottom right of the window.
- `notifications.foreground`: Notifications foreground color. Notifications slide in from the bottom right of the window.
- `notifications.background`: Notifications background color. Notifications slide in from the bottom right of the window.
- `notifications.border`: Notifications border color separating from other notifications in the notifications center. Notifications slide in from the bottom right of the window.
- `notificationLink.foreground`: Notification links foreground color. Notifications slide in from the bottom right of the window.

Since notifications are now displayed in a different way, all of the previously supported theme colors for notifications are no longer supported.
