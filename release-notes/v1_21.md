# February 2018 (version 1.21)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.21 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/43361)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/59?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the February milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Better drag and drop support

We revisited our support for drag and drop in the workbench and now allow for more drag and drop scenarios that were previously not possible. Probably the most upvoted scenario is to drag files from one file explorer to another window:

Other improvements are in the area of the Open Editors view. You can now:
* drag files from the explorer into a specific space of the Open Editors view
* drag files from the desktop into a specific space of the Open Editors view
* drag tabs into a specific space of the Open Editors view

### Copy/Paste files across windows

We now allow you to copy and paste files between 2 VS Code file explorers in different windows. This works for single- or multi-selection of files as well as folders.
