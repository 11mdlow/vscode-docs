We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Changes for Extension Authors

Due to security concerns, we don't want to render user provided SVG images within VS Code. We added constraints for extensions to make it safer for users when they browse the extension Marketplace within VS Code:

- The icon provided in `package.json` may not be an SVG.
- The badges provided in the `package.json` may not be SVGs unless they are from trusted badge providers.
- Image URLs in `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` need to resolve to `https` URLs.
- Images in `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` may not be SVGs unless they are from trusted badge providers.

Below are the URL prefixes which identify trusted badge providers:

- `https://api.travis-ci.org/`
- `https://badge.fury.io/`
- `https://badges.frapsoft.com/`
- `https://badges.gitter.im/`
- `https://badges.greenkeeper.io/`
- `https://cdn.travis-ci.org/`
- `https://ci.appveyor.com/`
- `https://codeclimate.com/`
- `https://coveralls.io/`
- `https://david-dm.org/`
- `https://gemnasium.com/`
- `https://img.shields.io/`
- `https://isitmaintained.com/`
- `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/`
- `https://snyk.io/`
- `https://travis-ci.com/`
- `https://travis-ci.org/`
- `https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/`
- `https://www.bithound.io/`

To help you adopt these constraints, VS Code shows linting errors in your extension's `package.json`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` files if they are not yet compliant. Also, the `vsce` publishing tool performs compliance checks and prevents you from uploading a new version of your extensions if there are problems.

## Workbench

### Command Palette improvements

We improved the **Command Palette** dropdown (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) to make it more useful.

One popular request was to always restore the last typed input when reopening the **Command Palette**. Enable this behavior with the new setting `workbench.commandPalette.preserveInput`.

We also added a most recently used (MRU) list of commands that is persisted between restarts. The most recent commands executed will always show to the top. A new setting `workbench.commandPalette.history` allows you to control the number of entries to show (set it to 0 to disable this feature). With the MRU enabled, you do not need to enable `workbench.commandPalette.preserveInput` because the history will always have the last executed command selected by default when you open the **Command Palette**.

A new command **Clear Commands History** was added to quickly dismiss all the entries from the commands history.

Finally, keyboard shortcuts in the dropdown are presented in the same visual form as in the **Keyboard Shortcuts** editor.

### Restore empty windows

In VS Code, you can work with windows that have folders opened as well as empty windows. An empty window is not opened to a specific folder but can show files from disk. Up to now, we would never restore the UI state of empty windows and you would lose your carefully selected layout of opened files (even on a window reload already).

With this release, we will restore the UI state for empty windows in the same way we do it for windows with opened folders.

![Empty Window Restore](images/1_14/empty-window-restore.gif)

A new setting `window.reopenWindows` configures this behavior. The possible values are:

* `none` - to never restore any windows
* `one` - to restore the last active window (default)
* `folders` - to only restore opened folders
* `all` - to restore all windows.

With the new setting `window.reopenWindows`, we deprecated the previous setting `window.reopenFolders` and ask you to switch to the new setting. We still support the old setting for a couple of releases.

### Close Unmodified Files

A new command was introduced to close unmodified editors of the currently active editor group. This makes it easy to quickly dismiss tabs of editors that are not dirty. The action can be triggered not only via a keybinding (`kb(workbench.action.closeUnmodifiedEditors)`) but also from the context menu of tabs as well as the **OPEN EDITORS** view in the Explorer.

Thanks to [Soney Mathew (@soneymathew)](https://github.com/soneymathew) for providing the pull request for this feature!

### Switch window improvements

In a previous release, we added a quick picker for switching between the opened windows (via the `workbench.action.switchWindow` command). In this release, we did some tweaks to make the experience better.

![Switch Windows](images/1_14/switch-window.png)

You will now see icons for the currently active file or folder in the window, provided that you have enabled one of the File Icon themes.

In addition, a new command `workbench.action.quickSwitchWindow` was added to quickly switch between opened windows. Press and hold the modifier key to cycle through the list of windows and release all keys to open it.

To use this feature with for example `Ctrl+R` key, configure the following rule in the keybindings editor:

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+r",
    "command": "workbench.action.quickSwitchWindow"
},
{
    "key": "ctrl+r",
    "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenNavigateNext",
    "when": "inWindowsPicker"
}
```

Press `Ctrl+R` and leave the `Ctrl` key pressed. As long as you now press the `R` key, you can navigate through the list of windows. Release all keys to focus it.

### New keybindings context per quick picker

Related to the improvements around the window picker, it is now easier and better to configure a picker with quick-pick functionality. Each time a picker opens, a specific keybinding context becomes active that you can use to assign keybindings to. For example, the window picker enables a context key `inWindowsPicker` when opened. Not only does it make quick navigate in pickers more powerful, it also fixes some annoying bugs (for example you can now bring up any quick picker, even if the quick picker is already showing - for example opening the files picker while the **Command Palette** is opened).

The following example demonstrates how to configure quick navigate keybindings to switch between the most recently opened folders:

To use this feature with for example `Ctr+R` key, configure the following rule in the keybindings editor:

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+j",
    "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenRecent"
},
{
    "key": "ctrl+j",
    "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenNavigateNext",
    "when": "inRecentFilesPicker"
}
```

Press `Ctrl+J` and leave the `Ctrl` key pressed. As long as you now press the `J` key, you can navigate through the list of recently opened folders and files. Release all keys to open it.

## Debugging

### Recipes for nonstandard debugging scenarios

Setting up Node.js debugging can be challenging for some non-standard or complex scenarios. In May, we've started to collect recipes for these scenarios in a [recipe repository](https://github.com/weinand/vscode-recipes).

This release adds a new recipe by [Tony Sneed (@tonysneed)](https://github.com/tonysneed) for [Chrome Debugging with Angular CLI](https://github.com/weinand/vscode-recipes/blob/master/Angular-CLI).

## Extension Authoring

### Debugger extensions

**New capability `supportsDelayedStackTraceLoading`**

In the May release we've improved stepping performance by fetching parts of the call stack and the corresponding variables lazily. Later we've learned that not all debug extensions were prepared to return the stack in chunks which could result in a [duplicated top stack frame](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28808).
Since we could not find a way to fix this problem in a robust way, we've decided that debug adapters have to opt-into the delayed loading of stack frames
explicitly. For this a new capability `supportsDelayedStackTraceLoading` has been introduced in the debug protocol.
So if the lazy loading of stack frames was working fine in your debug extension and if you know that your debug adapter already supports both the `startFrame` and the `levels` attribute of the `stackTrace` request, you should return `true` for the `supportsDelayedStackTraceLoading` capability. This ensures that you'll continue to see the improved stepping performance in the June release.
