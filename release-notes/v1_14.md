## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.14 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28387)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+milestone%3A%22June+2017%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs in the June milestone.
* **[Closed feature requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22June+2017%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afeature-request)** - Implemented feature requests.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Command Palette Improvements

The picker for all commands ((`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`)) got some nice improvements to make it more useful.

One popular request was to always restore the last typed input to the picker when opening the picker again. The new setting `workbench.commandPalette.preserveInput` can be set to true to get this behaviour.

Another thing we added is a most recently used list of commands that is persisted between restarts. The commands that you most recently executed will always show to the top. A new setting `workbench.commandPalette.history` allows to control the number of entries to show from this history (set it to 0 to disable this feature). With the history enabled, you do not really need to enable `workbench.commandPalette.preserveInput` because the history will always have the last executed command selected by default when you open the commands picker.

A new command "Clear Commands History" was added to quickly dismiss all the entries from the commands history.

Finally keybindings in the list are now presented in the same visual form as they are shown in the keybindings editor.

### Close Unmodified Files

A new command was introduced to close unmodified editors of the currently active editor group. This makes it easy to quickly dismiss tabs of editors that are not dirty. The action can be triggered not only via keybinding (`kb(workbench.action.closeUnmodifiedEditors)`) but also from the context menu of tabs as well as the "Open Editors" view in the explorer.

Thanks to [Soney Mathew (@soneymathew)](https://github.com/soneymathew) for providing the pull request on this feature!

### Switch Window Improvements

Since a couple of releases we have a quick picker for switching between the opened windows (via the `workbench.action.switchWindow` command). In this release we did some tweaks to make the experience better.

You will now see icons for the currently active file or folder in the window, provided that you have enabled one of the file icon themes. 

In addition, a new command `workbench.action.quickSwitchWindow` was added to quickly switch between opened windows. Press and hold the modifier key to cycle through the list of windows and release all keys to open it.

To use this feature with for example `Ctr+R` key, configure the following rule in the keybindings editor:

```json
{
	"key": "ctrl+r",
	"command": "workbench.action.quickSwitchWindow"
},
{
	"key": "ctrl+r",
	"command": "workbench.action.quickOpenNavigateNext",
	"when": "inWindowsPicker"
}
```

Press `Ctrl+R` and leave the `Ctrl` key pressed. As long as you now press the `R` key you can navigate through the list of windows. Release all keys to focus it.

### New keybindings context per quick picker

Related to the improvements around the window picker, it is now easier and better to configure a picker with quick-pick functionality. Each time a picker opens, a specific keybinding context becomes active that you can use to assign keybindings to. For example, the window picker enables a context key `inWindowsPicker` when opened. Not only does it make quick navigate in pickers more powerful, it also fixes some annoying bugs (for example you can now bring up any quick picker, even if the quick picker is already showing - for example opening the files picker while the commands picker is opened).

The following example demonstrates how to configure quick navigate keybindings to switch between the most recently opened folders:

To use this feature with for example `Ctr+R` key, configure the following rule in the keybindings editor:

```json
{
	"key": "ctrl+j",
	"command": "workbench.action.quickOpenRecent"
},
{
	"key": "ctrl+j",
	"command": "workbench.action.quickOpenNavigateNext",
	"when": "inRecentFilesPicker"
}
```

Press `Ctrl+J` and leave the `Ctrl` key pressed. As long as you now press the `J` key you can navigate through the list of recently opened folders and files. Release all keys to open it.

## Debugging

### Recipes for nonstandard debugging scenarios

Setting up Node.js debugging can be challenging for some non-standard or complex scenarios. In May, we've started to collect recipes for these scenarios in a [recipe repository](https://github.com/weinand/vscode-recipes).

This release adds a new recipe by [Tony Sneed (@tonysneed)](https://github.com/tonysneed) for [Chrome Debugging with Angular CLI](https://github.com/weinand/vscode-recipes/blob/master/Angular-CLI).

### Debugger extensions

Debug adapters now have to opt-into the delayed loading of stack frames by specifying a newly introduced capability `supportsDelayedStackTraceLoading`.
More about delayed loading of stack frames can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25605).

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.closeUnmodifiedEditors)`|Close unmodified editors of the currently active editor group|`workbench.action.closeUnmodifiedEditors`
`kb(workbench.action.quickSwitchWindow)`|Quickly switch between opened windows|`workbench.action.quickSwitchWindow`
