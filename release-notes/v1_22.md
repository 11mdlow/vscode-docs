# March 2018 (version 1.22)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.22 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/64?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the March milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Windows: workaround for scroll lag on certain devices

We have received numerous reports that scrolling on Windows on certain devices is very laggy and not smooth (see [issue 13612](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13612) for details). As a workaround to make scrolling smooth again, a new setting `window.smoothScrollingWorkaround` can be set to `true`. Since this is just a workaround which can result in a little bit of flicker whenever you restore the window from the task bar, this setting is not enabled by default. It has no other side effects other than that so you can enable it without having to worry.

## Extension Authoring

### Disposing a CancellationToken no longer sets the token to cancelled state

Calling `dispose()` on a `CancellationToken` previously would set the token to be cancelled and trigger the cancellation event. We changed this to no longer do so in order to be able to dispose tokens without cancelling them. If you rely on the cancellation of the token, call the `cancel()` method.

## Notable Changes

* [35675](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35675): Font rendering looks ugly on Linux
* [13905](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13905): Windows: Middle mouse click on taskbar icon doesn't open a new window
