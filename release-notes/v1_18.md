# October 2017 (version 1.18)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.18 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35875)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/52?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the October milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Support for Multi Root Workspaces

Support for multi-root workspaces is now enabled by default in the Stable release.

Please refer to our [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) for a full explanation of all the features that come with it. Extension authors should refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Extension-Authoring:-Adopting-Multi-Root-Workspace-APIs) that explains the new extension APIs to make your extension ready for multi-root workspaces.

### Blue Logo for Stable

The VS Code logo for Stable release is using blue as color now. You can read all about our icon journey in this [blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon).

**Note**: Depending on your platform, you may still see the earlier logo due to operating system caching of the application icon.

### Confirmations in File Explorer

We now present a confirmation dialog when moving files or folders in the File Explorer via drag and drop. This should prevent accidentally performing a move when not desired. If you never want to see the confirmation dialog, you can configure `explorer.confirmDragAndDrop` to `false`.

![Move confirmation](images/1_18/move-confirmation.png)

We also added a new setting, `explorer.confirmDelete`, to optionally hide our existing delete confirmation dialog.

**Note**: We will always show the confirmation dialog when if deleting a file or folder bypasses your platform's trash bin.

### Support Renamed Extensions

Market place now supports extension authors to change the name or the publisher of the extensions they own. We made VS Code to be resilient with such changes and can map installed extensions correctly with those extensions in the Market place which got renamed.

## Source Control

### Inline change review

You can now review source code changes right within the standard editor. This feature depends on whether it is supported by the source code provider but it is already enabled for Git repositories out of the box.

With this new UI, you can not only review your code changes but also navigate, stage or revert them inline.

### Git: Conflict Marker Detection

When staging a file which is flagged as having conflicts due to a merge or rebase, VS Code will check for the standard merge markers (for example `<<<<<<<`) and alert you if you forget to delete them when you are about to stage the file.

### Git: Improved Integration

Recently, there was a [patch to Git](https://public-inbox.org/git/20170921043214.pyhdsrpy4omy54rm@sigill.intra.peff.net/) which enables tools like VS Code to use `git status` without interfering with other concurrent Git commands. VS Code is now prepared for that upcoming Git change by using the right environment context (`GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS`) when spawning Git.

## Extension Authoring

### New workspace.name property

A new `workspace.name` property was added that provides (readonly) access to the name of the workspace. The name will be `undefined` if no workspace is opened.

### Configuration: Listen to specific changes

Now Configuration change event provides a `ConfigurationChangeEvent` object that has a method `affectsConfiguration` to check about configuration changes. You can also check if a configuration has changed for a resource.

```typescript
/**
 * An event describing the change in Configuration
 */
export interface ConfigurationChangeEvent {

	/**
	 * Returns `true` if the given section for the given resource (if provided) has affected.
	 *
	 * @param section Configuration name, supports _dotted_ names.
	 * @param resource A resource Uri.
	 * @return `true` if the given section for the given resource (if provided) has affected.
	 */
	affectsConfiguration(section: string, resource?: Uri): boolean;
}
```

### SCM: New menu: `scm/change/title`

Along with the new SCM inline change review, a new contributable menu context is now available: `scm/change/title`. It allows you to contribute commands to the header of an inline change review view.
