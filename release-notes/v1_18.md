## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.18 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

## Workbench

### Confirmations in files explorer

We are now presenting confirmation dialogs when moving files or folders in the files explorer via drag and drop. This should prevent to accidentally do this operation when not desired. If you want to never see the confirmation dialog, you can configure `explorer.confirmDragAndDrop` to `false`.

For our existing confirmation dialog when deleting from the files explorer, we added a new setting `explorer.confirmDelete` that can also be set to `false` to not be asked again.

**Note**: we will always show the confirmation dialog when deleting a file or folder is bypassing the trash.
