# October 2017 (version 1.18)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.18 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35875)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/52?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the October milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Support for Multi Root Workspaces

Support for multi-root workspaces is now enabled by default in the Stable release.

![Multi Root Workspaces](images/1_18/multiroot.gif)

Please refer to our [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) for a full explanation of all the features that come with it. Extension authors should refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Extension-Authoring:-Adopting-Multi-Root-Workspace-APIs) that explains the new extension APIs to make your extension ready for multi-root workspaces.

### Blue logo for Stable

The VS Code logo for Stable release is using blue as color now. You can read all about our icon journey in this [blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon).

![VS Code Logo](images/1_18/blueicon.png)

**Note**: Depending on your platform, you may still see the earlier logo due to operating system caching of the application icon.

### Git status in File Explorer

The Explorer now shows modified, added, conflicting, and ignored files in a different color and with a badge.

![Move confirmation](images/1_18/git-decorations.png)

The Git file decorations can be customized in many ways. You can hide the decorations entirely with the `git.decorations.enabled` setting and configure to only show colors `explorer.decorations.colors` or badges `explorer.decorations.badges`. There are new colors for theme authors which are prefixed with `gitDecoration`.

There is also a *proposed* API to allow extension authors to add color decorations to arbitrary resources. We haven't finalized on anything yet but are eager to learn how you would use decorations.

### Vertical panel

Per popular [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2806), we now support a vertical panel layout. Using the actions **Move to Right** and **Move to Bottom** in the panel title bar, panels can switch between being display on the bottom or the right side.

![Vertical Panel](images/1_18/vertical-panel.png)

### Panel title bar improvements

We have improved the panel title bar such that it is now possible to rearrange and hide panels as well as added overflow support. Overflow with an **Additional Views** dropdown is particularly useful when the panel is laid out vertically due to the lack of horizontal space.

![Panel title](images/1_18/panel-title.gif)

### Confirmations in File Explorer

We now present a confirmation dialog when moving files or folders in the File Explorer via drag and drop. This should prevent accidentally performing a move when not desired. If you never want to see the confirmation dialog, you can configure `explorer.confirmDragAndDrop` to `false`.

![Move confirmation](images/1_18/move-confirmation.png)

We also added a new setting, `explorer.confirmDelete`, to optionally hide our existing delete confirmation dialog.

**Note**: We will always show the confirmation dialog when if deleting a file or folder bypasses your platform's trash bin.

## Languages

### JSON

JSON now supports JSON Schema Draft 06. The most notable additions are the `const`, `contains` and `propertyNames' properties. Read [here](http://json-schema.org/draft-06/json-schema-migration-faq.html) for a more detailed overview of changes from draft 04.

## Source Control

### Inline change review

You can now review source code changes right within the standard editor. This feature depends on whether it is supported by the source code provider but it is already enabled for Git repositories out of the box.

![Move confirmation](images/1_18/diff.gif)

With this new UI, you can not only review your code changes but also navigate, stage or revert them inline.

### Git: Conflict marker detection

When staging a file which is flagged as having conflicts due to a merge or rebase, VS Code will check for the standard merge markers (for example `<<<<<<<`) and alert you if you forget to delete them when you are about to stage the file.

![Move confirmation](images/1_18/merge.png)

### Git: Improved integration

Recently, there was a [patch to Git](https://public-inbox.org/git/20170921043214.pyhdsrpy4omy54rm@sigill.intra.peff.net/) which enables tools like VS Code to use `git status` without interfering with other concurrent Git commands. VS Code is now prepared for that upcoming Git change by using the right environment context (`GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS`) when spawning Git.

## Debugging

### Debug in Status Bar

VS Code now shows the active debug launch configuration in the Status Bar. Clicking on the debug status, a user can change the active launch configuration and then start debugging without the need to open the Debug view.

![Debug status](images/1_18/debug-status.png)

### Focus actions

We have introduced new actions to easily move keyboard focus to the various Debug sections. This should make it easier for keyboard centric users to navigate while debugging.

These actions are:

* Focus Variables: `workbench.debug.action.focusVariablesView`
* Focus Watch: `workbench.debug.action.focusWatchView`
* Focus CallStack: `workbench.debug.action.focusCallStackView`
* Focus Breakpoints: `workbench.debug.action.focusBreakpointsView`

### Coloring of Debug Console evaluation results based on type

Debug console expressions are now colored based on the `type` property coming from the debug extension. This is currently supported by the node debugger extension.

![REPL Color](images/1_18/repl-color.png)

### Start without debugging shortcut

The default keyboard shortcut on macOS for **Debug: Start Without Debugging** changed to `kbstyle(ctrl + F5)` to avoid a collision with an existing macOS keyboard shortcut.

## Node Debugging

### More WSL support

A [first glimpse](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_17#_first-steps-towards-wsl-support) of support for Node.js debugging in the _Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)_ was already available in the previous milestone (but only for older versions of Node.js that still support the "legacy" protocol). In this milestone, another [pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-debug2/pull/142) by [Bartosz Sosnowski (@bzoz)](https://github.com/bzoz) was integrated that adds support for the "inspector" protocol that is used by more recent versions of Node.js. With this update, it is now possible to run Node.js v8 in WSL.

## Tasks

### Schema polish

The schema for the `tasks.json` file version `2.0.0` was updated. The `taskName` property is deprecated in favor of the `label` property to make it more consistent with contributed tasks. In addition, there is now a snippet for new tasks. By default, it creates a task of type `shell` to execute commands in the Integrated Terminal.

### Variable names

Last release, we deprecated the `${workspaceRoot}` variable in favor of `${workspaceFolder}` to make this consistent with multi-root workspace support. For the same reason, we are deprecating `${workspaceRootFolderName}`. Please use `${workspaceFolderBasename}` instead. This deprecation applies to debug launch configurations as well.

## Extension Authoring

### Support renamed extensions

The Marketplace now lets extension authors change the name or the publisher of their extensions. VS Code is resilient to such changes and maps installed extensions correctly to the new extension identity on the Marketplace.

### New Context: resourceExtname

There is a new context key to control keybindings and menu items. Its name is `resourceExtname` and its value will be the extension of the file in question.

### New workspace.name property

A new `workspace.name` property was added that provides (readonly) access to the name of the workspace. The name will be `undefined` if no workspace is opened.

### Configuration: Listen to specific changes

Now Configuration change event provides a `ConfigurationChangeEvent` object that has a method `affectsConfiguration` to check about configuration changes. You can also check if a configuration has changed for a resource.

```typescript
/**
 * An event describing the change in Configuration
 */
export interface ConfigurationChangeEvent {

    /**
     * Returns `true` if the given section for the given resource (if provided) has affected.
     *
     * @param section Configuration name, supports _dotted_ names.
     * @param resource A resource Uri.
     * @return `true` if the given section for the given resource (if provided) has affected.
     */
    affectsConfiguration(section: string, resource?: Uri): boolean;
}
```

### Async Inbox box validation

The `showInputBox`-function and its validation now support async validation. Like so:

```ts
vscode.window.showInputBox({
  async validateInput(value) {
    return await someLongRunningOperation(value);
  }
});
```

### Twisties-Less File Icon Themes

File icon themes can now disable twisties in tree views and use the folder icons to indicate the expansion state:

![Exporer without twisties](images/1_18/twistieless-fileicons.png)

To do so, file icons themes must specify `"hidesExplorerArrows":true` in the file icon theme definition file.
Thanks to [Ari](https://github.com/tam5) for the [PR](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/35856).

### SCM: New menu: `scm/change/title`

Along with the new SCM inline change review, a new contributable menu context is now available: `scm/change/title`. It allows you to contribute commands to the header of an inline change review view.

![Move confirmation](images/1_18/difftitle.png)

### Debug API updates

**Command `debug.logToDebugConsole` is deprecated**

With the introduction of a proper `vscode.debug.console.append(...)` API in the October release, it is no longer necessary to use the `debug.logToDebugConsole` command to append text to the debug console. Due to that we are deprecating the `debug.logToDebugConsole` command and plan to drop support for it in the November milestone. If it is difficult for you to move off this feature, please speak up by commenting [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34700).

> **Note:** Currently this API is proposed, so in order to use it you must opt into it by adding a `"enableProposedApi": true` to `package.json` and you'll have to copy the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) into your extension project. Also be aware that you cannot publish an extension to the Marketplace that uses the `enableProposedApi` attribute.

**Command `vscode.startDebug` has been removed**

As [announced](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_17#_debug-api-updates) in the previous release, we have now finally removed support for the `vscode.startDebug` command.

**Command `vscode.workbench.customDebugRequest` has been removed**

As [announced](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_17#_debug-api-updates) in the previous release, we have now finally removed support for the `vscode.workbench.customDebugRequest` command.

### Debug contributions in package.json

**Activation event `onDebug:type` has been removed**

As [announced](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_17#_debug-contributions-in-packagejson) in the previous release, we have now finally removed support for the `onDebug:type` activation event.

**Using `debuggers.startSessionCommand` in _package.json_ has been removed**

As [announced](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_17#_debug-contributions-in-packagejson) in the previous release, we have now finally removed support for the `startSessionCommand` command.

**Using command with `debuggers.initialConfigurations` in _package.json_ is deprecated**

As [announced](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_17#_debug-contributions-in-packagejson) in the previous release, we have now finally removed support for the `initialConfigurations` command.

**Updated documentation and mock-debug example**

With this release most of the command based debug API has been replaced by [proper API](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/86e057cd25756811781237b5d84b8228f99e59ab/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L5989-L6145) available through vscode.d.ts. Consequently, we have updated both the [documentation for debug extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-debuggers) and the underlying [mock-debug example](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug) for the new APIs.

## New commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.quickOpenPreviousEditor)`|Open quick file picker with the second entry selected by default|`workbench.action.quickOpenPreviousEditor`
`kb(workbench.action.openFolderAsWorkspaceInNewWindow)`|Open a folder as workspace in a new window|`workbench.action.openFolderAsWorkspaceInNewWindow`
`kb(workbench.action.removeRootFolder)`|Remove a root folder from the workspace|`workbench.action.removeRootFolder`
`kb(workbench.action.problems.show)`|Show Problems|`workbench.action.problems.show`
