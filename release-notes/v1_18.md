# October 2017 (version 1.18)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.18 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35875)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/52?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the October milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Support for Multi Root Workspaces

Support for multi-root workspaces is now enabled by default in the Stable release.

![Multi Root Workspaces](images/1_18/multiroot.gif)

Please refer to our [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) for a full explanation of all the features that come with it. Extension authors should refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Extension-Authoring:-Adopting-Multi-Root-Workspace-APIs) that explains the new extension APIs to make your extension ready for multi-root workspaces.

### Blue Logo for Stable

The VS Code logo for Stable release is using blue as color now. You can read all about our icon journey in this [blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon).

![VS Code Logo](images/1_18/blueicon.png)

**Note**: Depending on your platform, you may still see the earlier logo due to operating system caching of the application icon.

### Git Status in File Explorer

The explorer now shows modified, added, conflicting, and ignored files in a different color and with a badge.

![Move confirmation](images/1_18/git-decorations.png)

Git file decorations can be tweaked in many ways. Control them via `git.decorations.enabled` and configure if a only colors or just badges should be used. Do that with the `explorer.decorations.colors`-setting and the `explorer.decorations.badges`-setting. For theme-authors there are new colors, all are prefixed with `gitDecoration`.

There is also *proposed* api that allows extension authors to add color decorations to arbitrary resources. We haven't finalized on anything yet but are eager to learn how you would use it.

### Panel Title Area Improvements

We have improved the panel title area such that it is now possible to rearrange the items, hide and show the items and there is an overflow behavior. This should be of particular use when the panel is layed out vertically due to the lack of horizontal space.

![Panel title](images/1_18/panel-title.gif)


### Vertical Panel

As per popular [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2806) we now support a vertical panel layout. Using the action in the panel title area the panel can switch between the bottom and the right side.

![Vertical Panel](images/1_18/vertical-panel.png)

### Confirmations in File Explorer

We now present a confirmation dialog when moving files or folders in the File Explorer via drag and drop. This should prevent accidentally performing a move when not desired. If you never want to see the confirmation dialog, you can configure `explorer.confirmDragAndDrop` to `false`.

![Move confirmation](images/1_18/move-confirmation.png)

We also added a new setting, `explorer.confirmDelete`, to optionally hide our existing delete confirmation dialog.

**Note**: We will always show the confirmation dialog when if deleting a file or folder bypasses your platform's trash bin.

### Support Renamed Extensions

Market place now supports extensions authors to change the name or the publisher of the extensions they own. We made VS Code to be resilient with such changes and can map installed extensions correctly with those extensions with identity change in the Market place.

## Source Control

### Inline change review

You can now review source code changes right within the standard editor. This feature depends on whether it is supported by the source code provider but it is already enabled for Git repositories out of the box.

![Move confirmation](images/1_18/diff.gif)

With this new UI, you can not only review your code changes but also navigate, stage or revert them inline.

### Git: Conflict Marker Detection

When staging a file which is flagged as having conflicts due to a merge or rebase, VS Code will check for the standard merge markers (for example `<<<<<<<`) and alert you if you forget to delete them when you are about to stage the file.

![Move confirmation](images/1_18/merge.png)

### Git: Improved Integration

Recently, there was a [patch to Git](https://public-inbox.org/git/20170921043214.pyhdsrpy4omy54rm@sigill.intra.peff.net/) which enables tools like VS Code to use `git status` without interfering with other concurrent Git commands. VS Code is now prepared for that upcoming Git change by using the right environment context (`GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS`) when spawning Git.

## Debugging

### Debug in Status Bar

We are now showing the active debug launch configuration in the status bar. Debug status will help users understand what is the active launch configuration and will also help with the process of changing the active launch configuration without the need of opening the debug viewlet.

![Debug status](images/1_18/debug-status.png)

### Focus View Actions

We have introduced new actions to easily focus various debug views. This should make it easier for keyboard centric users to navigate while debugging. These actions are:
* Focus Variables: `workbench.debug.action.focusVariablesView`
* Focus Watch: `workbench.debug.action.focusWatchView`
* Focus CallStack: `workbench.debug.action.focusCallStackView`
* Focus Breakpoints: `workbench.debug.action.focusBreakpointsView`

### Coloring of Debug Console Evalution Results Based on Type

We are now coloring the evaluation of debug console expressions based on the `type` property coming from the debug extension. This is currently supported by the node debugger extension.

![REPL Color](images/1_18/repl-color.png)

### Start Without Debugging Shortcut

We have changed the default shortcut on macOS for `Debug: Start Without Debugging` to `ctrl + F5` due to a collision of the previous shortcut with built-in macOS functionality.

## Node Debugging

### More WSL support

A [first glimpse](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_17#_first-steps-towards-wsl-support) of support for Node.js debugging in the _Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)_ was already available in the previous milestone (but only for older versions of Node.js that still support the "legacy" protocol). In this milestone, another [pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-debug2/pull/142) by [Bartosz Sosnowski (@bzoz)](https://github.com/bzoz) was integrated that adds support for the "inspector" protocols that is used by recent version of Node.js. With this it is now possible to run Node.js v8 in WSL.

## Tasks

### Schema polish

The schema for the tasks.json file version `2.0.0` got polished. The `taskName` property got deprecated in favour of the `label` property to make it more consistent with contributed tasks. In addition there is now a snippet for new tasks. By default it creates a task of type `shell` to execute commands in a terminal.

### Variable names

Last release we deprecated the `${workspaceRoot}` variable in favour of `${workspaceFolder}` to make this consistent with the multi folder support now available. For the same reason we deprecated `${workspaceRootFolderName}`. Please use `${workspaceFolderBasename}` instead. This deprecated applies to debug launch configurations as well.

## Extension Authoring

### New Context: resourceExtname

There is a new context key to control keybindings and menu items. Its name is `resourceExtname` and its value will be the extension of the file in question.

### New workspace.name property

A new `workspace.name` property was added that provides (readonly) access to the name of the workspace. The name will be `undefined` if no workspace is opened.

### Configuration: Listen to specific changes

Now Configuration change event provides a `ConfigurationChangeEvent` object that has a method `affectsConfiguration` to check about configuration changes. You can also check if a configuration has changed for a resource.

```typescript
/**
 * An event describing the change in Configuration
 */
export interface ConfigurationChangeEvent {

	/**
	 * Returns `true` if the given section for the given resource (if provided) has affected.
	 *
	 * @param section Configuration name, supports _dotted_ names.
	 * @param resource A resource Uri.
	 * @return `true` if the given section for the given resource (if provided) has affected.
	 */
	affectsConfiguration(section: string, resource?: Uri): boolean;
}
```
### Async Inbox Box Validation

The `showInputBox`-function and its validation now support async validation. Like so:

```ts
vscode.window.showInputBox({
  async validateInput(value) {
    return await someLongRunningOperation(value);
  }
});
```

### SCM: New menu: `scm/change/title`

Along with the new SCM inline change review, a new contributable menu context is now available: `scm/change/title`. It allows you to contribute commands to the header of an inline change review view.

![Move confirmation](images/1_18/difftitle.png)

### Debug API updates

**Command `vscode.startDebug` is deprecated**

With the introduction of a proper `vscode.debug.startDebugging(...)` API in the July release, it is no longer necessary to use the `vscode.startDebug` command to start a debug session. Due to that we are no longer supporting the `vscode.startDebug` command.

**Command `vscode.workbench.customDebugRequest` is deprecated**

With the introduction of a proper `DebugSession.customRequest(...)` API in the July release, it is no longer necessary to use the `vscode.workbench.customDebugRequest` command to send a custom request to the debug adapter. Due to that we are no longer supporting the `vscode.workbench.customDebugRequest` command.

**Command `debug.logToDebugConsole` is deprecated**

With the introduction of a proper `vscode.debug.console.append(...)` API in the October release, it is no longer necessary to use the `debug.logToDebugConsole` command to append text to the debug console. Due to that we are deprecating the `debug.logToDebugConsole` command and plan to drop support for it in the November milestone. If it is difficult for you to move off this feature, please speak up by commenting [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34700).

### Debug contributions in package.json

**Activation event `onDebug:type` is deprecated**

With the introduction of the `DebugConfigurationProvider` API, it has become difficult to correctly support the activation event `onDebug:type` (where 'type' is a debug type). We recommend using the newly introduced activation event `onDebug` instead.
Due to that we are no longer supporting the `onDebug:type` activation event.

**Using `debuggers.startSessionCommand` in _package.json_ is deprecated**

With the introduction of the `resolveDebugConfiguration` method on type `DebugConfigurationProvider`, it is no longer necessary to contribute a `startSessionCommand` on the `debuggers` contribution point. Therefore we are no longer supporting the `startSessionCommand`.

**Using command with `debuggers.initialConfigurations` in _package.json_ is deprecated**

With the introduction of the `provideDebugConfigurations` method on type `DebugConfigurationProvider`, it is no longer necessary to contribute a command for the `debuggers.initialConfigurations` contribution point. Therefore we are no longer supporting the ability to specify a command ID.

## New commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.quickOpenPreviousEditor)`|Open quick file picker with the second entry selected by default|`workbench.action.quickOpenPreviousEditor`
`kb(workbench.action.openFolderAsWorkspaceInNewWindow)`|Open a folder as workspace in a new window|`workbench.action.openFolderAsWorkspaceInNewWindow`
`kb(workbench.action.removeRootFolder)`|Remove a root folder from the workspace|`workbench.action.removeRootFolder`
`kb(workbench.action.problems.show)`|Show Problems|`workbench.action.problems.show`
