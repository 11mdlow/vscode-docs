## Extension Authoring

### Profile Your Extension

You can now profile extensions using Chrome Dev Tools. Do the following:

1. Start VS Code from the command line the with `--inspect-extensions=<port>`-flag, e.g. `code --inspect-extensions=9333` 
2. In VS Code, hit `F1`, type `Toggle Developer Tools`, hit `Enter`
3. Select the *Console*-tab and find a message that starts with `"Debugger listening on port 9333"` and that ends with a `chrome-devtools`-link
4. Open that link in Chrome for dedicated dev-tools for the extension host
5. Use the CPU and Memory profiler to understand how memory and compute is being used
