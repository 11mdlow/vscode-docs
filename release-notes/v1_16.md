## Workbench

### Open a folder via drag and drop

VS Code always supported to drag a folder from outside the window into the window to open it. We still support this, but we changed the visual feedback a little bit: Previously you could drop the folder
anywhere into the window to open it. With this release, you need to drop the folder over the editor area to open it. There is a technical reason (Electron update) as well as an explicit decision to 
make the multi root experience better. If you are using VS Code insiders with multi root support you will be happy to hear that you can now drop a folder into the files explorer to add it to the workspace.

### Drag and drop from search results and problems view

You can now drag files from the search results and problems view over the editor area to control where these should open. The files explorer always supported this and we now expanded that feature to more areas.

### New icons

The application logo got a refresh during this milestone (TODO@Chris).

### Theming improvements

New theming color keys got introduced.
These colors can be set by themes or directly by the user with the `workbench.colorCustomizations` setting:

Key|Description
---|-------
`tab.activeBorder`|A border drawn to the bottom of the active tab.
`tab.unfocusedActiveBorder`|A border drawn to the bottom of the active tab in an editor group that is not focused.
`editorOverviewRuler.findMatchForeground`|Overview ruler marker color for find matches.
`editorOverviewRuler.rangeHighlightForeground`|Overview ruler marker color for range highlights.
`editorOverviewRuler.selectionHighlightForeground`|Overview ruler marker color for selection highlights.
`editorOverviewRuler.wordHighlightForeground`|Overview ruler marker color for symbol highlights.
`editorOverviewRuler.modifiedForeground`|Overview ruler marker color for modified content.
`editorOverviewRuler.addedForeground`|Overview ruler marker color for added content.
`editorOverviewRuler.deletedForeground`|Overview ruler marker color for deleted content.

See [Theme Color Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference) for a complete list of colors.


## Languages

### HTML

Tag elements are now automatically closed when `>` of the opening tag is typed:
![Auto close on `>`](images/1_16/auto-close1.gif)

The matching closing tag is inserted when `/` of the closing tag is entered:
![Auto close on `/`](images/1_16/auto-close2.gif)

The new behaviour is enabled by default and can be turned off with setting `html.autoClosingTags`

Thanks to [Jun Han](https://github.com/formulahendry) for leading the way with his [auto-close extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag). Note that the auto-close extension has more features, in particular, it can be enabled for languages other than HTML as well.


## Extension Authoring

### Profile Your Extension

You can now profile extensions using Chrome Dev Tools. Do the following:

1. Start VS Code from the command line the with `--inspect-extensions=<port>`-flag, e.g. `code --inspect-extensions=9333` 
2. In VS Code, hit `F1`, type `Toggle Developer Tools`, hit `Enter`
3. Select the *Console*-tab and find a message that starts with `"Debugger listening on port 9333"` and that ends with a `chrome-devtools`-link
4. Open that link in Chrome for dedicated dev-tools for the extension host
5. Use the CPU and Memory profiler to understand how memory and compute is being used


### Tooltip for source control resource decorations

Thanks to [@marckassay](https://github.com/marckassay), you can now have [tooltips on source control resource decorations](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/29644).

<!-- In-product release notes styles.  Do not modify without also modifying regex in gulpfile.common.js -->
<a id="scroll-to-top" role="button" aria-label="scroll to top" href="#"><span class="icon"></span></a>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/inproduct_releasenotes.css"/>

### Themable colors in extensions

Extension can now contribute new themable colors. These colors can be used in decorators and in the status bar.

```
        "colors": [{
            "id": "superstatus.error",
            "description": "Color for error message in the status bar.",
            "defaults": {
                "dark": "errorForeground",
                "light": "errorForeground",
                "highContrast": "errorForeground"
            }
        }]
```

Once defined, user can customize the color in the `workspace.colorCustomization` setting. User themes can set the color value.

## Preview: Multi Root Workspaces

>**Note:** Multi-root functionality is only available in the Insiders build until we are confident enough that we can make it available in Stable. To try it out, grab our Insiders build from [https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

We continued working on support for opening multiple folders in a single VS Code window (instance) ([issue #396](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/396)). There was a preview of this feature in our last releases (see [1.14.0 release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_preview-multi-root-workspaces) and [1.15.0 release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_preview-multi-root-workspaces)).

During this sprint, we focused on enabling extensions to be ready for multi-root workspaces and allowing to use source control in multi-root workspaces. We also revisited the workspace file format and made the transition into multi root workspaces more pleasant.

### New workspace file format

The contents of the workspace file (`*.code-workspace`) got some changes during this sprint. You do not have to worry about existing workspace files, they will get migrated to the new format automatically!

A new workspace file can now look like this:
```json
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "path": "monaco"
    },
    {
      "path": "Projects/vscode-distro"
    },
    {
      "path": "vscode-docs"
    },
    {
      "path": "/Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/vscode-extension-sdk"
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the `id` property is no longer part of the file. Instead, the location of the workspace file on disk is now used to derive an identifier for the workspace from. We use this identifier to associate various things with the workspace:
* all UI state (e.g. opened editors)
* dirty files (hot exit)
* extension storage

One advantage of this change is that you can now simply copy the workspace file on disk to open the same workspace into multiple windows.

Another change was done on the `folders` property: each entry is now an object which gives us some room for adding additional metadata to folders in the future. We also went away from using file resources as format for the folder paths and instead now simply expect paths in there. 

Finally, we now support relative paths in the workspace file! A relative folder path will be resolved against the folder the workspace file is stored into. We automatically store a path as relative if we detect that the location of the workpace file is a parent of the folder. Otherwise absolute paths will be used. 

### Smooth transition into multi-root workspaces

There are several ways how to turn an empty workspace or single-folder workspace into a multi-root workspace. The transition used to be a bit rough, e.g. it was not possible to do it with dirty files and all the UI state was lost when you entered the multi-root workspace. In this milestone we made the behaviour a lot smoother. We still require a window reload for now, but we have plans to even get rid of that to make the transition fast.

In the animation below you see how a single-folder window turns into a multi-root workspace. A couple of things happen:
* all UI state is migrated into the workspace and restored (vertical editor layout and opened editors)
* all dirty files are properly restored and you are not being asked to save
* workspace settings are copied over into the multi-root workspace (hidden status bar, hidden activity bar)

### More ways of getting into a multi-root workspace

We expanded the ways how you can get into a multi-root workspace in VS Code.

#### Command Line

A new command line argument `--add` was added. Use it to add folders provided as paths on the command line to the currently active window. This works for an empty workspace, a single-folder workspace as well as a multi-root workspace.

If you provide multiple folders to open from the command line, we used to open each folder in a separate window. Now, we automatically create a workspace for you and open all folders into a single window. 

#### Drag and Drop

If you drop folders into VS Code, we used to open each folder into a separate window. With multi-root support, we now instead open all folders into one window by creating a workspace for you automatically. In addition, you can now drop folders into the files explorer to add them to the workspace.

![Multi root drag and drop](images/1_16/multi-root-dnd.gif)

#### Native Controls

Finally, when you pick multiple folders from the native file dialog (via File | Open), we will open all folders at once into a workspace. The same is true when you drop multiple folders onto the application icon in the dock on macOS.

### Adoption to multi root workspaces

The following built-in languages supports have been updated to support folder specific settings in a multi root workspaces setup.

CSS, SCSS, LESS, JSON, HTML
