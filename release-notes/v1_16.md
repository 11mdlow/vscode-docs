We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Open a folder via drag and drop

VS Code has always supported dragging a folder from outside VS Code into it to open the folder. VS Code stills support this, but the visual feedback is changed a little bit. Previously you could drop the folder anywhere in VS Code to open it. With this release, you need to drop the folder over the editor area to open it. This change is due to both a technical reason (an Electron update) as well as an explicit decision to make the multi-root experience better. If you are using VS Code Insiders with multi-root support, you will be happy to hear that you can now drop a folder into the File Explorer to add it to the workspace.

![Open folder via drag and drop](images/1_16/folder-drop.gif)

### Drag and drop from Search results and Problems panel

You can now drag files from the Search results and Problems panel over the editor area to control where these should open. The Files Explorer always supported this and we have now expanded that feature to more areas.

![Drag and drop in search results](images/1_16/search-dnd.gif)

### New icons

There is a new Visual Studio Code application logo (TODO@Chris).

### Theming improvements

Several new theming color keys were introduced. These colors can be set by themes or directly by the user with the `workbench.colorCustomizations` setting:

- `tab.activeBorder`: A border drawn to the bottom of the active tab.
- `tab.unfocusedActiveBorder`: A border drawn to the bottom of the active tab in an editor group that is not focused.
- `editorOverviewRuler.border`: Color of the overview ruler border.
- `editorOverviewRuler.findMatchForeground`: Overview ruler marker color for find matches.
- `editorOverviewRuler.rangeHighlightForeground`: Overview ruler marker color for range highlights.
- `editorOverviewRuler.selectionHighlightForeground`: Overview ruler marker color for selection highlights.
- `editorOverviewRuler.wordHighlightForeground`: Overview ruler marker color for symbol highlights.
- `editorOverviewRuler.wordHighlightStrongForeground`: Overview ruler marker color for write-access symbol highlights.d
- `editorOverviewRuler.modifiedForeground`: Overview ruler marker color for modified content.
- `editorOverviewRuler.addedForeground`: Overview ruler marker color for added content.
- `editorOverviewRuler.deletedForeground`: Overview ruler marker color for deleted content.
- `editorOverviewRuler.errorForeground`: Overview ruler marker color for errors.
- `editorOverviewRuler.warningForeground`: Overview ruler marker color for warnings.
- `editorOverviewRuler.infoForeground`: Overview ruler marker color for infos.

See [Theme Color Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference) for a complete list of colors.

## Terminal

### Terminal quick open improvements

The terminal quick open that can be launched via the `workbench.action.quickOpenTerm` command of by typing "term " in quick open now has the ability to create new terminals and kill existing terminals.

![Terminal quick open improvements](images/1_16/terminal-quick-pick.png)

### Session names on Windows

The mechanism for extracting the session name from the terminal shell which was added in v1.15.0 no longer needs to spin up a new process, this should reduce CPU usage when using the terminal.

### Force selection using Shift on Linux and Windows

Running programs in mouse mode within the terminal (like tmux) will intercept the mouse and therefore not allow you to make a selection. You can now hold the `Shift` key to force the mouse event to perform a selection rather than be sent to the terminal. This functionality was added for Alt and macOS in v1.15.0.

### Terminal Find Widget improvements

The terminal find widget now support find history. You can use `kb(workbench.action.terminal.findWidget.history.showNext)` and  `kb(workbench.action.terminal.findWidget.history.showPrevious)` to show next or previous find term in the find widget. Many thanks to [Christopher Leidigh](https://github.com/cleidigh), which has helped with both code refactoring and feature implementation in [pr #32113](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/32113).

![Terminal Find Widget improvements](images/1_16/terminal-find.gif)

## Editor

### Snippets

There is a new snippet-variable: `$TM_FILENAME_BASE`. It resolves to the filename without extension, so from `/my/super/file.ts` it resolves to `file`.

### Smooth scrolling

Thanks to the work of [@JD342](https://github.com/JD342) in [PR #25286](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/25286), the editor now has a new option, `editor.smoothScrolling`, that will make the editor scroll with an animation. Once enabled, scrolling between different locations when using page up or page down, when cycling through find matches, when jumping to a definition in the same file, when using the mouse wheel, etc. will be animated.

> Note: Our platform currently does not support differentiating between scrolling initiated by a touchpad or a physical mouse wheel, and we currently use a heuristic to determine if smooth scrolling should be applied.

![Smooth Scrolling](images/1_16/smooth-scrolling.gif)

### Undo stack preserved when file changes on disk

Thanks to the work of [Ryan Stringham](https://github.com/stringham) in [PR #29655](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/29655), VS Code will now preserve the undo stack associated with a open file when it is reloaded due to a change on disk.

### Emmet suggestions as snippets and customizations

In this release we have 2 new settings to improve your Emmet experience in VS Code.

Emmet in suggestions/auto-completion list is most helpful when it is in the top few choices. There are two scenarios where Emmet suggestions can get pushed down the list:

   - You have set `editor.snippetSuggestions` to `top` and so default/user/extension snippets are on top of your suggestion list.
   - When working on stylesheets, Emmet suggestions get sorted alphabettically among other css suggestions.

To ensure Emmet suggestions stay on top of the suggestion list, set the new setting `emmet.showSuggestionsAsSnippets` to `true` and `editor.snippetSuggestions` to `top`.

The setting `emmet.preferences` as documented in [Emmet Preferences](https://docs.emmet.io/customization/preferences/) was discontinued in the last release as the new modular approach in Emmet 2.0 did not support them. We are bringing back support for a few of these preferences.
    - `css.propertyEnd`
    - `css.valueSeparator`
    - `sass.propertyEnd`
    - `sass.valueSeparator`
    - `stylus.propertyEnd`
    - `stylus.valueSeparator`
    - `css.unitAliases`
    - `css.intUnit`
    - `css.floatUnit`

 If you want support for any of the other preferences, please log a [feature request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/new) for the same.

## Languages

### HTML

Tag elements are now automatically closed when `>` of the opening tag is typed:

![Auto close on `>`](images/1_16/auto-close1.gif)

The matching closing tag is inserted when `/` of the closing tag is entered:

![Auto close on `/`](images/1_16/auto-close2.gif)

The new behavior is enabled by default and can be turned off with setting `html.autoClosingTags`

Thanks to [Jun Han](https://github.com/formulahendry) for leading the way with his [auto-close extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag). Note that the auto-close extension has more features, in particular, it can be enabled for languages other than HTML as well.

### TypeScript 2.5

VS Code now includes TypeScript 2.5.2, which brings some exciting new editor features and fixes a number of bugs. You can read more about TypeScript 2.5 [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2017/08/31/announcing-typescript-2-5/). Highlights include:

#### Extract method and Extract function

The new extract method and extract function code actions allow you to quickly refactor complex code into new methods or functions:

![](images/1_16/ts-extract.gif)

Simply select some code, then click on the lightbulb in the gutter or press (`kb(editor.action.quickFix)`) to see available refactorings. Code fragments can be extracted into a new method, or into a new function at various different scopes.

#### JSDoc type assertions

You can now use write JSDocs type assertions in JavaScript files:

```js
// @ts-check

const img = /** @type {HTMLImageElement} */ (document.getElementById('#cat'))
img.src = './cat.gif'
```

This is particularly useful when using `@ts-check` to enable [type checking in your JavaScript code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript#_type-checking-and-quick-fixes-for-javascript-files).

### Per root folder implicit projects for loose JavaScript and TypeScript files

Loose JavaScript and TypeScript files that are not part of a `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` project are now split into an implicit project per root folder. Previously, loose files across all root folders in the workspace were grouped into the same implicit project. This means that you should no longer see suggestions from files in one JavaScript workspace showing up in JavaScript files in a separate workspace.

### Markdown preview refresh command

The new `markdown.refreshPreview` command allows you to manually refresh the contents of a Markdown preview.

![](images/1_16/markdown-refresh.png)

This can be used to reload images that have been modified on the file system.

### CSS/JSON

We moved the inline color box rendering from CSS/JSON extensions to VSCode core so we'll deprecate four configuration settings `css.colorDecorators.enable`, `sass.colorDecorators.enable`, `scss.colorDecorators.enable` and `json.colorDecorators.enable`, instead we are providing a new setting `editor.colorDecorators` to control if inline color box should be rendered.

## Accessibility

It is now possible to change the cursor position in VS Code using braille routing keys on a connected braille display when using NVDA on Windows. Many thanks to [James Teh](https://github.com/jcsteh), which has helped with steps to emulate the behaviour of a braille display in [issue #27216](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27216).

## Extension Host

VS Code uses a multi-process architecture, where extensions are executed in a separate extension host process. The workbench can now recover gracefully from an unexpected termination of the extension host process: all UI elements and state driven from extensions will be removed (e.g. squiggles, status bar items, etc.), and, if the extension host is restarted, everything will return to normal.

> In the following gif, the extension host process is terminated. When the extension host terminates, basic editing still works, word completions are presented, and once the extension host is restarted, the real TypeScript powered completions come in:

![Extension Host Restart](images/1_16/exthost-restart.gif)

## Extension Authoring

### Profile Your Extension

You can now profile extensions using Chrome DevTools. Do the following:

1. Start VS Code from the command line the with `--inspect-extensions=<port>`-flag, for example `code --inspect-extensions=9333`.
2. In VS Code, from the **Command Palette** (`F1`), select **Developer: Toggle Developer Tools**, hit `Enter`.
3. Select the **Console** tab and find a message that starts with `"Debugger listening on port 9333"` and that ends with a `chrome-devtools`-link.
4. Open that link in Chrome for dedicated DevTools for the extension host.
5. Use the CPU and Memory profiler to understand how memory and compute is being used.

### Handling of Uncaught Errors

The extension host process is now looking at the stack-traces of uncaught errors to know what extension is throwing them. For now, we only prefix those errors with the respective extension ids but for the future we have more plans, e.g. an extension runtime view, the ability to create an issue against extensions etc.

### Tooltip for source control resource decorations

Thanks to [@marckassay](https://github.com/marckassay), you can now have [tooltips on source control resource decorations](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/29644).

<!-- In-product release notes styles.  Do not modify without also modifying regex in gulpfile.common.js -->
<a id="scroll-to-top" role="button" aria-label="scroll to top" href="#"><span class="icon"></span></a>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/inproduct_releasenotes.css"/>

### Themable colors in extensions

Extension can now contribute new themable colors. These colors can be used in decorators and in the Status Bar.

```json
  "colors": [{
      "id": "superstatus.error",
      "description": "Color for error message in the status bar.",
      "defaults": {
          "dark": "errorForeground",
          "light": "errorForeground",
          "highContrast": "errorForeground"
      }
  }]
```

Once defined, user can customize the color in the `workspace.colorCustomization` setting. User themes can set the color value.

### Debug API updates

Currently a debugger extension can contribute the "hook"-like commands `initialConfigurations` and `startSession` to participate in the generation of an initial launch configuration and the start of a debug session. In this milestone we are proposing a "real" API that will replace the more-or-less untyped command based mechanism with a typed solution. At the same time we are deprecating the `initialConfigurations` and `startSession` commands (and we will remove them at a later time).

The new API centers around a `DebugConfigurationProvider` which is registered for a specifc debug type (which itself is contributed via a `debuggers` contribution as before).
Whenever VS Code needs the initial debug configurations for a newly created launch.json it calls `provideDebugConfigurations` on the registered `DebugConfigurationProvider`s.
A method `resolveDebugConfiguration` is called by VS Code when a new debug session is started. The implementation of `resolveDebugConfiguration` can "massage" the passed debug configuration by filling in missing values or by adding/changing/removing attributes.

> **Note:** Currently this API is proposed, so in order to use it you must opt into it by adding a `"enableProposedApi": true` to `package.json` and you'll have to copy the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) into your extension project. Also be aware that you cannot publish an extension to the Marketplace that uses the `enableProposedApi` attribute.

### Debug Contributions

**Variable substitution in _package.json_ is no longer supported**

We are no longer supporting variable substitution in the `program` and `runtime` attributes of the `debuggers` contribution in `package.json`. The reason for this is twofold: first, it is hard to explain that variable substitution only works for two attributes and not for all attributes in `package.json`. Second, with multi-root folders, it is difficult to support this feature in a useful way.


### Debug Adapter Protocol

**Source link attributes added to output event**

We've added a `source`, `line`, and `column` attribute to the `Output` event type . With this a frontend can show a link to the source where the output was generated.
Please note: VS Code does not yet support this feature in the UI.

**Loaded scripts support**

We've added support for retrieving loaded scripts (`LoadedSourcesRequest`) and receiving loaded script events (`LoadedSourceEvent`).
Please note: VS Code does not yet support this feature in the UI. The newly introduced "Loaded Scripts" explorer for JavaScript debugging does not yet use this protocol but we are planning to migrate it to the new protocol.

**Display hints for variables and evaluation results**

We've added display hints for variables and evaluation results (type `VariablePresentationHint`). A frontend can use these hints when rendering variables or evaluation results, e.g. for selecting specific icons that reflect their visibility.

### Extension Debugging

Now that we are using Electron 1.7, we are debugging the extensionHost process with the new "inspector" protocol debug adapter that you've been using to debug Node 8. Here is one difference worth pointing out:


The new debug adapter doesn't mark breakpoints as "verified" until they are bound at a real position in the runtime. This means that if your extension is not yet activated, breakpoints will appear gray. But don't worry, they will turn red as soon as the extension is activated.

![eh breakpoints](images/1_16/eh-breakpoints.gif)

## Preview: Multi Root Workspaces

>**Note:** Multi-root functionality is only available in the Insiders build until we are confident enough that we can make it available in Stable. To try it out, grab our Insiders build from [https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

We continued working on support for opening multiple folders in a single VS Code window (instance) ([issue #396](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/396)). There was a preview of this feature in our last releases (see [1.14.0 release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_preview-multi-root-workspaces) and [1.15.0 release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_preview-multi-root-workspaces)).

During this milestone, we focused on updating extensions to be ready for multi-root workspaces and source control support. We also revisited the workspace file format and made the UI transition into multi-root workspaces more pleasant.

### New workspace file format

The contents of the workspace file (`*.code-workspace`) was changed during this sprint. You do not have to worry about existing workspace files, they will be migrated to the new format automatically!

A new workspace file now looks like this:

```json
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "path": "monaco"
    },
    {
      "path": "Projects/vscode-distro"
    },
    {
      "path": "vscode-docs"
    },
    {
      "path": "/Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/vscode-extension-sdk"
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the `id` property is no longer part of the file. Instead, the location of the workspace file on disk is used to derive an identifier for the workspace. We use this identifier to associate various items with the workspace:

* All UI state (for example, opened editors)
* Dirty (unsaved) files (for Hot Exit)
* Extension storage

One advantage of this change is that you can now simply copy the workspace file on disk to open the same workspace into multiple windows.

Another change was done on the `folders` property: each entry is now an object which gives us the possibility of adding additional metadata to folders in the future. We also went away from using file resources as the format for the folder paths and now simply use paths.

Finally, we support relative paths in the workspace file! A relative folder path will be resolved against the folder where the workspace file is stored. We automatically store a path as relative if we detect that the location of the workspace file is a parent of the folder. Otherwise the absolute path will be used.

### Smooth transition into multi-root workspaces

There are several ways to turn an empty workspace or single-folder workspace into a multi-root workspace. The transition used to be a bit rough, for example, it was not possible transition with unsaved files. In addition, all the UI state was lost when you created a multi-root workspace. In this milestone, we made the behavior a lot smoother. We still require a window reload, but we have plans to get rid of that step to make the transition fast.

In the animation below you can see how a single-folder window turns into a multi-root workspace. A couple of things happen:

* All UI state is migrated into the workspace and restored (vertical editor layout and opened editors).
* All dirty (unsaved) files are properly restored and you are not prompted to save.
* Workspace settings are copied over into the multi-root workspace (hidden Status Bar, hidden Activity Bar)

![Multi root transition](images/1_16/multi-root-transition.gif)

### More ways to create a multi-root workspace

We expanded the ways to create a multi-root workspace in VS Code.

#### Command line

There is a new command line argument `--add`. Use it to add folders on the command line to the currently active window. The new folder argument should be provided as a path. This works for an empty workspace, a single-folder workspace, as well as an existing multi-root workspace.

If you provide multiple folders to open from the command line, we used to open each folder in a separate window. Now, we automatically create a workspace for you and open all folders into a single window.

#### Drag and drop

If you drop folders into VS Code, we used to open each folder into a separate window. With multi-root support, we now open all folders into one window by creating a workspace for you automatically. In addition, you can now drop folders into the File Explorer to add them to the workspace.

![Multi root drag and drop](images/1_16/multi-root-dnd.gif)

#### Native controls

Finally, when you pick multiple folders from the native file dialog (via **File** > **Open**), we will open all folders at once into a workspace. The same is true when you drop multiple folders onto the application icon in the dock on macOS.

### Updates for multi-root workspaces

The following built-in languages have been updated to support folder specific settings in a multi-root workspaces setup: CSS, Sass (SCSS), Less, JSON, and HTML. In addition the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)  and [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) extensions have been updated to support multi-root workspaces.

### Multi-root and the Language Server Protocol

Proposed protocol has bee added to the LSP to support multi-root workspaces. Both the [VS Code language client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-languageclient) and the [VS Code language server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-languageserver) have been updated to support the proposed protocol. In addition VS Code's language client has been enhanced to support a server per workspace folder. A corresponding example can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/multi-lsp-sample)

## Miscellaneous
