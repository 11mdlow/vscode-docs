## April Release Summary

Welcome to the April 2017 release of Visual Studio Code. For this iteration, we shifted from our usual focus on new features to improving our processes and code base. We reviewed and triaged open issues, fixed a lot of bugs, and reduced engineering debt. We still think you'll find plenty to be excited about in this release.

## Workbench

### Workbench Theming

* New yo generator to create workbench themes.
* Daniel Imms (@Tyriar) theme generator.
* Built-in themes adopting new colors.
* New colors to set: list/tree, diff editor, activity foreground, notifications, scrollbar, splitview, buttons.
* Settings moved out of experimental API.

### Source Control

Since the SCM API was released, there has been quite some progress in source control extensions around the community. Here are some of the few extensions already published in the Marketplace:

- [Visual Studio Team Services](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsts.team), providing features for local TFVC workspaces
- [Perforce for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.perforce)
- [Hg](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mrcrowl.hg), for Mercurial repositories

We are very excited about the possibilities of this API and certainly expect more extensions to come out in the near future!

#### Git

There has been a lot of progress polishing and improving the [Git extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/git) inside Code. This Git integration goes through the same [extension points](#source-control) as third-party SCM providers.

**Note:** Starting in June, the legacy git integration will be completely removed. Until then, you can still revert back to it using the **SCM: Enable Legacy Git** command.

### macOS: Sierra Tabs

With the help of the Electron update, we can bring back basic support for native macOS Sierra tabs for window management. You can enable them via the `window.nativeTabs` setting after a restart. Once enabled, depending on your OS settings, new tabs will open when you open new windows. Make sure to show the tab bar (View > Show Tab Bar) to access tabs.

**Note**: Native tabs cannot be used with a custom title. When you enable native tabs, the title bar will change to native styling too.

### macOS: Mouse swipe to navigate

We added a new setting `workbench.editor.swipeToNavigate` that allows you to navigate between editors using 3-finger-swipe gesture with the trackpad on macOS. Swiping left or right will navigate across recently used editors in any editor group. This is similar to the **Go** > **Back** and **Go** > **Forward** commands we already had but will skip navigation from occurring within documents.

**Note**: The same commands that swiping triggers can also be executed via key bindings from the new commands `workbench.action.openPreviousRecentlyUsedEditor` and `workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditor`.

**Note**: We currently only support 3-finger-swipe gesture. Make sure that your trackpad settings for swiping are configured like the following to make this work:

* Swipe between pages: Scroll left or right with three fingers.
* Swipe between full-screen apps: Swipe left or right with four fingers.

## Editor

### Dynamic IntelliSense Sorting

The editor now re-sorts the completions-list while you type. That ensures that the completions you need are always ontop and easy to select.

## Tasks

Grunt autodetection has been implemented for the new terminal task runner. With the new terminal runner tasks are now detect for both Grunt and Gulp if both corresponding files are present in a workspace.

In addition the proposed task API has been polish. Soi if you started to use it you might encounter minor breakages.

## Languages

## Debugging

### Editing watch expressions
It is now possible to edit watch expressions using the context menu.

## Node Debugging

### Just My Code improvements

Skipping files on stepping has been available for the `inspector` protocol of the node-debugger for three releases. With this release it is now available for the `legacy` protocol as well.
To control a file for skipping use the contect menu action "Toggle Skipping this File" on a stack frame in the CALL STACK view.

### Column Breakpoints Improvements

## Extension Authoring

### Node.js update (6.x to 7.x)

With the update of Electron to 1.6.6, the Node.js version that is used to run all extensions updated from 6.4.0 to 7.4.0. There are some breaking changes coming with this major update of Node.js, though in general the impact should be minor. Please refer to [this overview](https://github.com/nodejs/node/wiki/Breaking-changes-between-v6-and-v7) for a complete list of breaking changes from Node.js 6 to 7.

One consequence of the Electron update is that promise rejections are now treated as uncaught exceptions by the node runtime even if the reject is caught later. Since this behavior is annoying when debugging an extension, we've introduced a new exception option to control promise rejections independent from regular exceptions:

![new promise rejection option](images/1_12/promise-reject-option.png)

### Debug Extensions

* **`evaluateName` attribute will become mandatory for `Add to Watch` and `Copy Value` actions**

VS Code tries to implement the `Add to Watch` and `Copy Value` actions by using the data from the VARIABLES view and a  JavaScript-biased heuristic for building expressions that can be used with the evaluate request.

Since this approach does not work for all languages, we've introduced the `evaluateName` attribute for variables some time ago. If the `evaluateName` attribute is available for a variable VS Code will use it 'as is' for the evaluate request. If `evaluateName` is missing VS Code falls back to the old approach.

Since we plan to remove the fallback completly in the May release, debug adapters must support the `evaluateName` attribute if they want to have the `Add to Watch` and `Copy Value` actions available in the future.

* **New argument `terminateDebuggee` for `disconnect` request**

An optional argument `terminateDebuggee` has been added to the `disconnect` request. If a debug adapter has opted into this feature with the 'supportTerminateDebuggee' capability, a client can use this to control whether the debuggee should be terminated when the debugger is disconnected.

## Miscellaneous

### Electron update

In this release, we updated from Electron 1.4.x to 1.6.6. This brings a Chrome update from version 53 to 56 and Node.js from 6.4 to 7.4. Among other things, this update enabled us to bring back native macOS Sierra tabs for window management (behind a setting `window.nativeTabs`) as well as better crash reporting for the processes we spawn. This update also avoids some graphic glitches we have seen on macOS (background artifacts) as well as improved scaling of all UI elements when running with scaling enabled on Windows.

Unfortunately, we are also seeing some regressions with this update and we ask for your patience until we can move forward to a newer Electron version that fix these issues.

Specifically:

* [24981](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24981): Backspace can not erase the last one character during Chinese/Japanese IME conversion (macOS)
* [24633](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24633): Unconfirmed text of CJK IME collapse to one character in Integrated Terminal
* [24643](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24643): Webview Flickering on Resize
* [24707](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24707): 1.6.2 update (<1.5) Completely breaks Dragon menu/submenu voice control (updated)

**Note:** If you are an extension author, please review the impact of this Electron update under the [Extension Authoring](#extension-authoring) section.

### China

We've made efforts to improve the install & update experience for Chinese users, who have always reported slow download speeds when fetching releases of VS Code. We now publish and distribute our releases to network servers located within China so you should start getting much faster speeds in that territory. Some of our test scenarios witnessed a speedup of `300x` ⚡️!

These improvements are already available when downloading VS Code directly from our website as well as when receiving automatic updates.

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.openPreviousRecentlyUsedEditor)`|Open Previous Recently Used Editor|`workbench.action.openPreviousRecentlyUsedEditor`
`kb(workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditor)`|Open Next Recently Used Editor|`workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditor`

## Notable Changes

* [5745](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5745): Webview: apply window.zoomLevel too
