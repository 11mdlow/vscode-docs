### Debug Extensions

* **`evaluateName` mandatory for `Add to Watch` and `Copy Value` action**

Debug adapter now needs to provide the `evaluateName` field for a variable in order for the `Add to Watch` and `Copy Value` action to use the correct variable path. Currently VS Code is using a language specific heuristic which will get removed in May.
