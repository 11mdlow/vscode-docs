## April Release Summary

Welcome to the April 2017 release of Visual Studio Code. For this iteration, we shifted from our usual focus on new features to improving our processes and code base. We reviewed and triaged open issues, fixed a lot of bugs, and reduced engineering debt. We still think you'll find plenty to be excited about in this release.

## Workbench

### macOS Sierra Tabs

With the help of the Electron update, we can bring back basic support for native macOS Sierra tabs for window managment. You can enable them via the `window.nativeTabs` setting after a restart. Once enabled, depending on your OS settings, new tabs will open when you open new windows. Make sure to show the tab bar (View > Show Tab Bar) to access tabs.

Note: this is only a first cut of support for native tabs on macOS Siera. We still miss some functionality but will update this feature as soon as we can.

### macOS: mouse swipe to navigate

We added a new setting `workbench.editor.swipeToNavigate` that allows to navigate between editors using 3-finger-swipe gesture with the trackpad on macOS. Swiping left or right will trigger the history navigation commands (Go > Forward, Go > Back).

**Note**: we currently only support 3-finger-swipe gesture. Make sure that your trackpad settings for swiping are configured like the following to make this work:
* Swipe between pages: Scroll left or right with two fingers
* Swipe between full-screen apps: Swipe left or right with three fingers

## Editor

## Languages

## Debugging

## Extension Authoring

### node.js update (6.x to 7.x)

With the update of Electron to 1.6.6, the node.js version that is used to run all extensions updated from 6.4.0 to 7.4.0. There are some breaking changes coming with this major update of node.js, though in general the impact should be little to none. Please refer to [this overview](https://github.com/nodejs/node/wiki/Breaking-changes-between-v6-and-v7) for a complete list of breaking changes from node.js 6 to 7.

### Debug Extensions

* **`evaluateName` mandatory for `Add to Watch` and `Copy Value` action**

Debug adapter now needs to provide the `evaluateName` field for a variable in order for the `Add to Watch` and `Copy Value` action to use the correct variable path. Currently VS Code is using a language specific heuristic which will get removed in May.

## Miscellaneous

### Electron update

In this release, we updated from Electron 1.4.x to 1.6.6. This brings a Chrome update from version 53 to 56 and node.js from 6.4 to 7.4. Among other things, this update enabled us to bring back native macOS Sierra tabs for window management (behind a setting `window.nativeTabs`) as well as better crash reporting for the processes we spawn. This update also avoids some graphic glitches we have seen on macOS (background artifacts) as well as improved scaling of all UI elements when running with scaling enabled on Windows.

Unfortunately we are also seeing some regressions with this update and we ask for your patience until we can move forward to a newer Electron version that fix these issues. Specifically:
* [24981](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24981): Backspace can not erase the last one character during Chinese/Japanese IME conversion (macOS)
* [24633](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24633): Unconfirmed text of CJK IME collapse to one character in Integrated Terminal
* [24643](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24643): Webview Flickering on Resize
* [24707](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24707): 1.6.2 update (<1.5) Completely breaks Dragon menu/submenu voice control (updated)

__Note:__ if you are an extension author, please review the impact of this Electron update under the _Extension Authoring_ category
