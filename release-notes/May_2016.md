## Editor

### Trim auto whitespace

Thanks to [PR #5423](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/5423) by [@outcoldman](https://github.com/outcoldman), there is a new option `editor.trimAutoWhitespace`, which is on by default, that makes the editor track the automatic whitespace it inserted and remove it if it no longer is needed (typing somewhere else). This helps keep your source code nice and tidy!

### Select all find matches

Thanks to [PR #5715](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/5715) by [@Inori](https://github.com/Inori), when searching for something, by pressing `kbstyle(Alt+Enter)` you can now immediately select all the find results:

![](images/May/selectAllFindMatches.gif)

### Configure Word Based Suggestion

When a language service isn't able to compute semantic completion (suggestions), VS Code defaults to word based completions. Word based completions can be disabled with the `editor.wordBasedSuggestions`-setting.

### Resizable Peek View

The peek view editor that shows for reference search and for previewing declarations can now be resized.

## Workbench

### Tabs
We have been working on implementing the designs for tabs and editor groups in this milestone and will continue to do so in the next milestone

We got some great feedback during our May UX study that has helped us make further improvements to the design:
* Redesign the overflow icon
* Provide a setting for choosing whether or not files from quick open are pinned or previewed
* Add a command to turn a previewed file into a pinned file


### Integrated terminal

The initial version of the integrated terminal ([#143](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/143)) has been implemented. The terminal can be triggered using `kb(workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal)` or by triggering the **View** > **Toggle Terminal** command in the **Command Palette**.

The shell that is used defaults to `$SHELL` on Linux and OS X, and `%COMSPEC%` on Windows. These can be overridden manually by setting `terminal.integrated.shell.*` in settings. It should act just like the terminal you're familiar with.

![](images/May/integrated-terminal.png)

This is an early version of what we want to deliver, currently it only supports a single terminal and is still missing features like copying and pasting with the keyboard. We wanted to get it into your hands as soon as possible and continue iterating with your feedback.

Some Windows 10 users may experience problems getting cmd.exe to work, if so you can try enabling the legacy terminal as described in [#143](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/143#issuecomment-221054202).

If you experience any issues or think of possible improvements, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/new) against the GitHub repository. You can see a [list of current bugs and feature requests here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aintegrated-terminal).

## Languages

### CSS

CSS / SASS / LESS editors can now identify CSS variables and provide IntelliSense, Go to and Peek Definition and Find All Occurrences support.

### vscode-eslint

There is now support for a fix all problems command which can be bound to a keyboard shortcut. The command id is: `eslint.fixAllProblems`

### vscode-tslint

There is now support for quick fixing some TSLint warnings.

## Keybindings

### Removing a specific keybinding rule

It is now possible to write a keybinding rule that targets the removal of a specific default keybinding. With the `keybindings.json` it was always possible to redefine all the keybindings of VS Code, but it can be very difficult to make a small tweak, especially around overloaded keys, such as `kbstyle(Tab)` or `kbstyle(Escape)`. From now on, simply add a `-` to the `command` and the rule will be a removal rule. Here is an example:

```
// In Default Keyboard Shortcuts
...
{ "key": "tab", "command": "tab", "when": ... },
{ "key": "tab", "command": "editor.emmet.action.expandAbbreviation", "when": ... },
{ "key": "tab", "command": "jumpToNextSnippetPlaceholder", "when": ... },
{ "key": "tab", "command": "acceptQuickFixSuggestion", "when": ... },
{ "key": "tab", "command": "acceptSelectedSuggestion", "when": ... },
...

// To remove the second rule, for example, add in keybindings.json:
{ "key": "tab", "command": "-editor.emmet.action.expandAbbreviation" }

```


## Debugging

### Control opening the Debug Console

We have introduced a setting `internalConsoleOptions` in `launch.json` to change the behavior of automatic revealing of the Debug Console.
`internalConsoleOptions` can have the following values: `neverOpen`, `openOnSessionStart` and `openOnFirstSessionStart`.

## Node.js Debugging

### Improved Stepping Performance

To improve the stepping experience for programs with a large number of local variables per scope, we've made the following adjustments:

* If a scope has more than 100 local variables, the VS Code Node.js debugger no longer auto expands that scope automatically.
* After the user has expanded the scope manually, only the first 100 local variables are shown.
* In both cases, the scope header reflects the fact that there are many locals and only a subset is shown:

![Peek](images/May/many-locals.png)

If you need to track a variable that is not within the first hundred, you can add it as a Watch expression or evaluate it in the Debug Console.

## Extension Authoring

### Debug extension API

We have exposed a `vscode.startDebug` command as an extension API for the VS Code debugger component. With this, a debug session can be started programmatically either by passing the name of a launch configuration or a complete launch configuration object:

```js
    let launchConfig = {
        type: "node",
        request: "launch",
        program: "${workspaceRoot}/test.js",
        cwd: "${workspaceRoot}"
    };

    vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.startDebug', launchConfig).then(() => {
        vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Debug session started successfully');
    }, err => {
        vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Error: ' + err.message);
    });
```

More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/4615).

### Text mate grammar injections

Extensions can now contribute textmate grammars that inject new rules into the existing gramars used for syntax highlighting. This makes it possible to add colorization inside string literals or comments, such as highlighting of URLs or TODO markers across multiple languages.

```json
"grammars": [
  {
    "scopeName": "source.todo",
    "path": "./syntaxes/todo.tmLanguage",
    "injectTo": [  "source.js", "source.ts" ]
  }
]
```


### Comparing files

We have added a new API command that allows you to use the diff-editor on two arbitrary resources like so: `commands.executeCommand('vscode.diff', uri1, uri2)`

### Updated extension samples

There is a new rich extension sample that walks you through _virtual documents_, _eventing_, and using _language features as commands_. Also, the preview html sample was updated:

* [contentprovider-sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/contentprovider-sample)
* [previewhtml-sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/previewhtml-sample)

### Debug Adapter: Support a 'One' or 'All' mode of operation for controlling threads

In a previous revision of the VS Code Debug Protocol, we had introduced a `allThreadsStopped` attribute on the `StoppedEvent`. With this attribute, a debug adapter can report back to the frontend whether only a single thread or all threads have stopped. Thanks to developer feedback, we learned that a similar attribute is necessary for the `ContinueRequest` too.

In the version 1.9.0 of the [VS Code Debug Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node), a boolean attribute `allThreadsContinued` has been added to the response from the `ContinueRequest`. Using this attribute, a debug adapter can report back to the UI whether only a single thread or all threads are continuing. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6400).

## Automation

### CLI Extension Management

It's now possible to list, install and uninstall extensions from the command line. This mechanism
helps in automating tasks. For the most common use case, the recommended way is still the in-product
experience: `ext install`.

Example:

```
code --list-extensions
code --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools
code --uninstall-extension ms-vscode.csharp
```

## Language Server Protocol

The protocol now offers support for telemetry notifications. In addition message tracing support has been implemented in the [node client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-languageclient) to help tracking down problems in the server. It can be enabled via a settings `${clientName}.trace.server` where client name is the name passed when creating the `LanguageClient` instance. For example `eslint.trace.server` for the eslint linter service.

## The Monaco Editor

We have been working on creating a public release of the Monaco Editor (a code editor based on the same sources as VS Code's text editor that runs in any browser). The first result is [an exploration](https://github.com/alexandrudima/monaco-typescript) where the standalone editor TypeScript language has been extracted from VS Code's sources and can run on top of the standalone editor API. We are working on polishing its API and automating some manual tasks in packaging it, such that it can be in a great shape when we create the first public release of it.
