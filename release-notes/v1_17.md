If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Editor

### editor.lightbulb.enabled

The new `editor.lightbulb.enabled` setting enables or disables the code action light bulb in the editor. The default value is `true`.


## Languages

### TypeScript 2.5.3

VS Code now includes TypeScript 2.5.3. This updates brings a few important fixes and improvements, with a focus on the extract method refactoring.

### Extract method refactorings in JavaScript and TypeScript now automatically triggers rename

The extract method and extract function refactoring for JavaScript and TypeScript will now automatically trigger a rename on the extracted method or function.

### JavaScript and TypeScript IntelliSense now support markdown

Suggestions and parameter hints for JavaScript and TypeScript now render markdown content.

### Improvements to JSX language scoping

JavaScript expressions inside of JSX tags now are correctly marked as being of the JavaScript language. This fixes a number of bugs around basic language features such as bracket matching and code commenting.

### Markdown fenced code blocks now set language modes

Fenced code blocks in markdown files now set the language mode for their contents. This means that basic language features such as bracket matching and code commenting now use the settings for the fenced code block's language rather than the generic markdown language settings:

### Detection of Markdown reference links

Reference links and reference link definitions are now detected as links in the editor:

```md
Some text with a [link][link definition] in it

[link definition]: /path/to/link
```

Clicking on `link definition` will jump to `[link definition]:`. `/path/to/link` is now also detected as a link.
