# June 2016 (version 1.3)

The June release of VS Code has some great new features, enhancements to existing features, and a set of important bug fixes.

Here are the highlights:

* **Editor**: TBD
* **Workbench**: TBD
* **Languages**: TBD
* **Debugging**: TBD
* **Extensions**: TBD

Please continue reading for more information on what's new in June.

## Editor

### Emmet
Thanks to some great support from Denis Malinochkin ([@mrmlnc](https://github.com/mrmlnc)) through Pull Requests and testing help, we are now covering all Emmet features (Wrap with Abbreviation, Remove Tag, Update Tag, Balance, Toggle Comment, ...). 

### Suggestions for command identifiers

When authoring the `keybindings.json` file you now get completions for the available commands.

## Workbench

### Editor Stacks

As a preparation for enabling Tabs in the workbench (more details below), we revisited how you can interact with editors in VS Code.

Many users coming from other editors were confused by some of the editor (open file) behavior in VS Code. For example:

* Closing a dirty editor (an editor with an unsaved file) did not prompt for saving.
* Closing an editor, closed the entire group without revealing the previous editor.
* The editor history showed a list of all editors ever opened and not a list of editors you opened in a group.
* WORKING FILES view in the Explorer was a confusing concept (read more on the new OPEN EDITORS view below).

With editor **stacks**, we've tried to address these issues:

* You can open up to 3 **editor groups** side by side and each group contains a **stack of editors**.
* Every time you open an editor, it is added to the top of the stack.
* Closing an editor from a group reveals the editor that was previously opened in that group until the last editor closes and the group hides.
* You get prompted to save for dirty editors.

Use `kb(workbench.action.openPreviousEditorInGroup)` to bring up a list of most recently used editors of a group for navigation. Press `kb(workbench.action.showAllEditors)` to show a list of all open editors across all groups.

![Editor Stacks](images/June_2016/stacks.png)

Note that the behavior of editor stacks is independent from having Tabs enabled or not. You will benefit from these changes even if you don't want to use Tabs.

**Note:** Due to the large conceptual impact of editor stacks, many command ids have been renamed and new commands introduced. Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6605) that documents the changes. It also provides guidance if you liked the previous behavior and explains how to change keybindings back to the old behavior.

### Preview Editors

Closely related to editor stack and Tabs are **preview editors**. If you click around many files, you might not want to see a Tab opened for each file you open. Preview editors are helpful to reduce the number of opened editors (and Tabs). An editor will open as preview if you open it by single clicking in the Explorer. As long as the editor stays in preview mode, other editors that open will open in the same location as the preview editor. Basically you are reusing the editor for each file you open.

Certain actions cause a preview editor to become a normal editor:

* When you modify the contents of a file, the editor will be kept open.
* The same is true for when you double click on a file in the Explorer or inside a Tab or move a file to a specific editor group.

Preview editors are indicated using an italic font style.

![Preview Editor](images/June_2016/preview_editor.png)

We introduced new settings to control the behavior of preview editors:

* `workbench.editor.enablePreview` to globally enable or disable preview editors
* `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromQuickOpen` to enable or disable preview editors when opened from quick open

### Tabs

With this release, you can enable Tabs for open files by configuring the new `workbench.editor.showTabs` setting. Enabling this setting will display Tabs for each opened editor in the title area above an editor. You can move Tabs around via drag and drop or right click on a Tab to explore some useful actions.

![Tabs](images/June_2016/tabs.png)

In case when the available space for Tabs is not enough to show all files, you will see Tabs overflowing to the left and right. You can always use the mouse to scroll left and right across all tabs. The little overflow icon (see image below) shows enabled as soon as there are Tabs outside of the visible view. Clicking on the overflow icon shows a list of all Tabs opened in the group.

![Tabs Overflow](images/June_2016/overflow.png)

You can use the new `workbench.editor.openPositioning` setting to control where new editors should open. By default they open to the right of the active Tab, but you can change this to open to the left, or to the beginning or end of all editors.

### Opened Editors view

The new **OPEN EDITORS** view in the Explorer is the replacement to the previous **WORKING FILES** view.

TODO@Isidor

You can hide the OPEN EDITORS view by setting `"explorer.openEditors.visible": 0`.

**Note:** Since the WORKING FILES view has been deleted, please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6605) to get an overview of the new or changed command identifiers.

### More powerful Drag and Drop

With all the work on Tabs, we also looked at improving the drag & drop support in the editor. We always allowed you to drop files from outside VS Code into the editor to open the files and now there is a lot more that you can do:

#### Drop to Split

Drag some files to the left or right area of an editor to open it to the side of that editor. You can either drag from the Explorer or a Tab if Tabs are enabled.

![Drop to split](images/June_2016/dnd_editor.gif)

#### Drop Feedback

Whenever you are dragging files or a Tab over the editor area, you now get drop feedback to indicate the target position of the drop.

#### Drag from Explorer and Opened Editors view

You can now drag a file or editor from the Explorer and the OPEN EDITORS view to the editor space to open it at a specific location.

### Open Recent in new Window

The command **File: Open Recent** from the **Command Palette** makes it very easy to quickly switch between previously opened folders or files. Usually the selected file or folder would open in the running instance. In this release, we added support to open into a new window if you select an entry while having the `kbstyle(Ctrl)` (`kbstyle('Cmd')` on Mac ) key pressed.

### Restore Full screen

A new setting `window.restoreFullscreen` has been added to open VS Code in full screen if it was previously closed in full screen mode.

### Problems panel

With the June release, we now offer a new **Problems** panel, docked at the bottom in the tool, that shows errors, warnings and other information generated by different sources like language servers, linters and others. This make it very easy to navigate through your issues and fix them while the editor is still open.

![Problems](images/June_2016/problems.png)

A filter box is provided to search and filter among the problems shown. You can either filter by type or by text, for example, 'errors' will filter for all problems of type error. 'character' will filter for problems with messages containing the word 'character'.

You can open the Problems panel using `kb(workbench.actions.view.problems)`, from the **View** | **Problems** menu, or from the **View** > **Show Problems** command in the **Command Palette**. The key binding `kb(workbench.actions.view.problems)` that was used to show errors and warnings in a Quick Open dropdown will now open the Problems panel and toggles focus between the panel and the editor.

By default, the Problems panel scrolls and shows problems for your active file. If you don't want this automatic reveal behavior, you can disable it through a setting `problems.autoReveal`. Set `problems.autoReveal` to `false` to prevent your Problems view from changing as you switch between active files.

>**Note:** This view is just a representation of markers generated by the language servers or linters or build tasks or any external builders configured in or outside your workspace. You have to configure or customize them appropriately in order to see the expected problems.

### Integrated terminal

## Languages

### Extract CSS/LESS/SCSS and JSON into extensions

The CSS, LESS, SCSS language supports have been refactored to be a regular VSCode extension.
As all these languages are based on the same code base, they share a language server. The language server runs in a separate node process, using the [language server protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) to communicate with VS Code. The language server protocol is also used by C#, JSON, Powershell, TSLint and many more.

### Make CSS/LESS/SCSS and JSON language services available in the Moanco editor

Additionally, the CSS/LESS/SASS parser and language smarts code have been extracted to a separate node module [vscode-css-languageservice](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice) which is
used by both the [Monaco editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) as well als VSCode, bringing the same CSS editing experience to the web browser.

Same for JSON, where the language service, including the JSON schema validator, were extracted to [vscode-json-languageservice](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-json-languageservice) which again is shared with the [Monaco editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor).

### Atom JavaScript grammar
As an alternative to the built-in JavaScipt grammar you can now install the [Atom JavaScipt grammar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-atom-grammar).
It differs from the built-in grammar in that it creates tokens for variable and function references
which, if supported by the theme, can be colorized differently.

## Debugging


## Extension Authoring

New capibilities have been added to the decoration APIs. You can now add 'attachments' before and after
a decoration. Attachments can be icons as well as text content that sticks to the decorated text.
An example are the CSS color decorators attached to color values in the text.
![Decorator attachment](images/June_2016/color_decorators.png)

Decoration attachments can be defined on decoration types (see ThemableDecorationInstanceRenderOptions, before & after) 
and fine tuned on individual decorations (see ThemableDecorationRenderOptions, before & after)

## Notable Bug Fixes

The SASS mode language id has been renamed from 'sass' to 'scss'. If you have customized any linter settings for Sass, just rename the configuration keys from 'sass.' to 'scss.'.

* [6316](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6316): Update should reopen all last opened folders
* [1210](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1210): Open file dialog should start in the directory for the current active file

These are the [closed bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+milestone%3A%22June+2016%22+is%3Aclosed) and these are the [closed feature requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22June+2016%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afeature-request) for the 1.3 update.
