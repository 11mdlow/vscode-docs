# June 2016 (version 1.3)

The June release of VS Code has some great new features, enhancements to existing features, and a set of important bug fixes.

Here are the highlights:

* **Editor**: TBD
* **Workbench**: TBD
* **Languages**: TBD
* **Debugging**: TBD
* **Extensions**: TBD

Please continue reading for more information on what's new in June.

## Editor

## Workbench

### Tabs

### Problems view

Is it much productive to have a view docked in the tool that shows all problems at one place where you can navigate through and fix them, while the editor is open? With the June release, we offer such a view called **Problems view** that shows errors, warnings and other information generated by different sources like linters.


![Problems](images/June_2016/problems.png)

You can open the Problems view using `kb(workbench.actions.view.problems)`, from the **View** | **Problems** menu, or from the **View** > **Show Problems** command in the **Command Palette**. The key binding **(CTRL | CMD) + SHIFT + M ** that used to show errors and warnings in command palette before, will now open Problems view and toggles focus between the view and the editor.

A filter box is provided to search and filter among the problems shown in the view. You can either filter by type or by text, for eg: "errors" will filter for all errors. "character" will filter for problems with message containing 'character'.

>**Note:** This view is just a representation of markers generated by the linters or build tasks or extensions or external builders configured in or outside your workspace. You have to configure or customize them appropriately in order to see the expected problems.

### Integrated terminal

## Languages


## Debugging


## Extension Authoring
