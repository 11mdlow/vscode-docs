# April 2018 (version 1.23)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.23 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/47369)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/66?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the April milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Improved handling of UTF-16 encoded files

VS Code always supported the UTF-16 encoding for files but so far required a BOM (byte order mark) to properly detect this encoding. Otherwise we refused to open the file and showed an information text instead why the file was not opened.

With this release we added a new action to this message to open the file as text in the editor:

![Open binary](images/1_23/binary.png)

Once opened you can then change the encoding accordingly to try to decode the text.

On top of that we now have a heuristic that tries to detect UTF-16 without BOM automatically. This heuristic should work for all UTF-16 files that only contain ASCII characters.

## Notable Changes
