# April 2018 (version 1.23)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.23 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/47369)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/66?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the April milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Editor

### Highlighted indent guides

VS Code can now highlight the active indent guide, as you move your cursor between various source code blocks. The color name is `editorIndentGuide.activeBackground`:

![Highlighted indent guides](images/1_23/active-indent-guide.gif)

### Improved editor positioning

In certain cases when changing the editor scroll height (such as resizing a wrapped editor, using mouse wheel zooming, or modifying  a CodeLens), the editor would attempt to maintain the centered line in the viewport. VS Code now maintains the first line in the viewport, providing a more stable appearance.

![Improved editor stability](images/1_23/editor-stability.gif)

### Column selection using middle mouse button

In VS Code, column selection can be added by holding `Shift` and `Alt` and then using the left mouse button. Now the middle mouse button can also be used to create a column selection:

![Editor column selection](images/1_23/editor-column-select.gif)

> Note: When setting `editor.multiCursorModifier` to `ctrlCmd`, the modifiers are `Shift` and `Ctrl` on Windows and `Shift` and `Cmd` on macOS.

### Run Code Actions on save

The new `editor.codeActionsOnSave` setting lets you configure a set of Code Actions that are run when a file is saved. For example, for JavaScript, TypeScript, and other extensions that contribute an organize imports Code Action, you can enable organize imports on save by [setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings):

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
     "source.organizeImports": true
}
```

You can also enable or disable which Code Actions are run on save per language using a [language specific setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_language-specific-editor-settings). The following settings enable organize imports on save for TypeScript files only:

```json
"[typescript]": {
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.organizeImports": true
    }
},
"[typescriptreact]": {
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.organizeImports": true
    }
}
```

## Workbench

### Improved handling of UTF-16 encoded files

VS Code always supported the UTF-16 encoding for files but required a BOM (byte order mark) to properly detect this encoding. If VS Code didn't find a BOM, the file would not be opened and the user saw an information message.

With this release, we added a new action to this message to open the file as text in the editor:

![Open binary](images/1_23/binary.png)

Once opened, you can then change the encoding to try to decode the text.

In addition, we now have a heuristic that tries to detect UTF-16 without a BOM automatically. This heuristic should work for all UTF-16 files that contain only ASCII characters.

### Include/Exclude files in Problems view

You can now include or exclude files in the Problems view using filters.

* Use glob patterns in the filter input box to include/exclude files. An exclude pattern must be prefixed with `!`. For example, `!*.js` will remove all files that have a .js extension.
* There is an **Filter using Files Exclude Setting** button to remove all files matching your `files.exclude` setting.

The short video below shows filtering the project `out` directory based on the `files.exclude` setting and ignoring all `node_modules` by typing `!**/node_module/**`":

![Filter problems](images/1_23/problems_filter.gif)

### NPM script running

With the setting `npm.enableScriptExplorer`, you can enable an explorer that shows the scripts defined in your workspace.

![Filter problems](images/1_23/script-explorer.png)

The explorer supports:

* Open a script inside a `package.json` file or the `scripts` section when the `package.json` file is selected. This is the default action when selecting a script.
* Run a script as a [task](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks) with the output shown in the Integrated Terminal.
* Debug a script. To launch the node debugger, the script needs to define a node debug option like `--inspect-brk` ([see also](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_launch-configuration-support-for-npm-and-other-tools)).

Use the setting `npm.exclude` to exclude scripts in `package.json` files contained in particular folders.

### Copy results from search context menu

The search results tree context menu includes three new options: "Copy", "Copy Path", and "Copy All". This was a highly 👍'd request which will make it easier to share or export your search results.

![Copy search](images/1_23/copy-search.gif)

### Return of the separate search include and exclude input boxes

Last month, we merged the include and exclude input boxes in the search viewlet in an attempt to simplify and streamline it, while also saving a little vertical space. However, we [heard from **many**](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/46315) of you that this didn't fit with the way you were using the search viewlet. Eventually we decided to simply revert the change, so with this release we are back to the same separate include/exclude boxes that we had before 1.22. Note that you **don't** need to use `!` on patterns in the exclude box.

![include exclude](images/1_23/search-include-exclude.png)

### See the running Visual Studio Code processes

Use the **Developer: Open Process Explorer** command or `Help>Open Process Explorer` to open a new window that contains continuously updating information about running VS Code processes. Processes are listed with their CPU and memory usage, PID, and friendly name, and can be killed from a context menu that appears on right-clicking.

![Process Explorer](images/1_23/process-explorer.gif)

### Git Clone improvements

There have been a few improvements to the Git Clone experience. When running the `Git: Clone` command:

- A native dialog is used to pick the repository location;
- The new notification progress API is used, improving the operation status reporting; and
- Code will prompt you whether you'd like to add the cloned repository to your workspace or open it directly.

## Languages

### Improved CSS/SCSS/Less region folding

You can now use `/* #region */` and `/* #endregion */` to mark a region as foldable in CSS/SCSS/Less.
In SCSS/Less, you can also use `// #region` and `// #endregion` as folding markers.

![Improved CSS Folding](images/1_23/css-folding.gif)

### Improved CSS support for new properties powered by MDN data

Previously, VS Code would show "Unknown Property" error for some experimental CSS properties, such as `backdrop-filter`:

![CSS backdrop-filter](images/1_23/css-backdrop-filter.png)

You would either have to turn off CSS linting completely or endure this error, even if you are using CSS frameworks such as [PostCSS](http://postcss.org) that allows you to use experimental CSS properties.

Not any more in the new release. With data sourced from [Mozilla Developer Network](https://github.com/mdn/data), VS Code now identifies 87 new CSS properties. If you can find a property on MDN, VS Code should recognize it.

Furthermore, with data from MDN, VS Code now provides enhanced completions in CSS/SCSS/Less, showing the syntax and status value of each CSS properties.

![CSS Support powered by MDN data](images/1_23/css-mdn.gif)

Although there is no built-in support for validating CSS property values yet, the [CSSTree Validator Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=smelukov.vscode-csstree) also uses data from MDN and offers linting for each property value based on its [Value Definition Syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Value_definition_syntax):

![CSSTree](images/1_23/css-csstree.gif)

### Markdown workspace symbol search

Markdown now has support for workspace symbol search. After opening a Markdown file for the first time, you can use (`kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)`) to search through the headers of all Markdown files in the current workspace:

![Markdown workspace symbol in the VS Code docs repo](images/1_23/markdown-workspace-symbol-search.png)

### Persistent Markdown previews

Markdown previews are now automatically restored when you reopen VS Code:

![A Markdown preview automatically being reopened when VS Code restarts](images/1_23/markdown-restore.gif)

Previously, previews had to be reopened whenever you restarted VS Code.

## Debugging

### Logpoint improvements

Logpoints were introduced in the last release and we've improved their ease of use and usefulness:

* IntelliSense has been added for expressions embedded in log messages and conditional breakpoints.
* When using Logpoints in Node.js debugging, structured objects embedded in the log message appear as expandable object in the debug console:

  ![IntelliSense for Logpoint expressions](images/1_23/logpoints.gif)

* Logpoints in Node.js debugging now show their real source location in the debug console, instead of their eval context:

  ![Logpoint location](images/1_23/logpoint-location.png)

* Since Logpoints and breakpoints can be easily deleted by clicking on their icon in the editor's gutter, you can accidentally lose a log message or a breakpoint condition. To prevent this, we now prompt when a breakpoint with a condition or log message is deleted by clicking in the gutter. The alert gives you the option to disable the breakpoint instead of deleting it.

* Last but not least, we've added a **New Breakpoint** > **Logpoint...** action to the **Debug** menu.

## Extension Authoring

### Contributions to the Activity Bar

As more and more extensions are creating custom views and the majority of them are contributed to the Explorer, we noticed the Explorer was getting cluttered. To scale up, VS Code now provides a way to contribute to the Activity Bar. As an example there is now a `Test` contribution to the Activity Bar. Extensions can now make their own contributions.

**Test view container**

A new Test contribution is now provided in the Activity Bar for the extensions to contribute Test related views. This Test contribution is empty and hidden by default and is shown whenever views are contributed to it. The example shows how the `mocha` custom view is contributed to the `Test` activity in the activity bar.

```json
"contributes": {
    "views": {
        "test": [
            {
                "id": "mocha",
                "name": "mocha"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

![Test views container](images/1_23/test-views-container.png)

**Custom view containers**

An extension can now define additional activities in the Activity Bar using the contribution point `viewsContainers`.

```json
"contributes": {
        "viewsContainers": {
            "activitybar": [
                {
                    "id": "package-explorer",
                    "title": "Package Explorer",
                    "icon": "resources/package-explorer.svg"
                }
            ]
        },
        "views": {
            "package-explorer": [
                {
                    "id": "package-dependencies",
                    "name": "Dependencies"
                },
                {
                    "id": "package-outline",
                    "name": "Outline"
                }
            ]
        }
}
```

![Custom views container](images/1_23/custom-views-container.png)

 **Icon specifications**

* `Size:` Icons are 24x24 centered on a 50x40 square.
* `Color:` Icons have a fill color of  `rgb(215, 218, 224)` or `#d7dae0`.
* `Format:` It is recommended that icons be in SVG, though any image file type is accepted.
* `States:` All icons inherit the following state styles:

  |State|Opacity
  |-|-|
  |Default|60%
  |Hover|100%
  |Active|100%

A command is registered to show each registered view container. In the Package Explorer example above, it would be **View: Show Package Explorer**. You can also find all view containers listed when you run the command **View: Open View...**.

![Open View](images/1_23/open-view.png)

**NOTE:** It is recommended that you group related views into a single view container instead of creating a view container for each view.

### Custom views in Source Control

You can now contribute Source Control Management (SCM) related custom views into the Source Control view container in the Activity Bar. You can show, hide and re-order these views just like in the Explorer.

```json
"contributes": {
    "views": {
        "scm": [
            {
                "id": "git-compare",
                "name": "Compare"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

![SCM Custom views](images/1_23/custom-view-scm.png)

### FileSystem Providers

Extensions can now serve files and folders from arbitrary sources, like ftp-servers, and VS Code will handle them just like regular files. To do so, use the `FileSystemProvider` interface which an extension associates with a URI scheme, like `ftp`. With that interface, the editor can discover and manage files and folders (create, delete, read, and write).

![Files and Folders from a filesystem provider](images/1_23/fsp.png)

VS Code can also read and modify configuration files (`settings.json`, `tasks.json`, `launch.json`) served by FileSystem Providers.

**Language Identifiers and Document Selectors**

The addition of FileSystem Providers means that not all files live on disk and extensions should be aware of this. The short, but **important**, message is that not all documents live on disk and if your extension relies on disk-access, you **must** check the [scheme](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/470d92886a599302aa16e84ea8330817a7faef6f/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L91) first.

To raise awareness, we have added an information message which shows when you register a language feature using just a language identifier, not a document filter. For more details, visit the [Document Selector](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/document-selectors) topic.

Last, there is a sample extension which you can use for testing. It implements a filesystem that keeps everything in memory, nothing is on disk, and you can test your language features against that. Get the extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jrieken.vscode-memfs).

**Watch out: TextDocument.isUntitled**

Due to the addition of FileSystem Providers, we have adjusted the semantics of `TextDocument.isUntitled` to be `true` only for newly created documents (using the `untitled` scheme). Before, all documents not from disk were treated as untitled. This change might alter the behavior of your extension, especially if it assumes that documents that aren't untitled are stored on disk.

### Reading Diagnostics

There is new API to read diagnostics and to be notified when diagnostics change, see `languages.getDiagnostics` and `languages.onDidChangeDiagnostics`. For instance, an SCM extension can now check that there are no errors before sharing changes with the team.

### Refined RenameProvider

We have refined the `RenameProvider` API and it can now, optionally, implement a new function called `prepareRename`. With that function, the provider can help VS Code resolve and validate the symbol to be renamed.

### Include offset based information in document change events

`TextDocumentContentChangeEvent` has a new property, `rangeOffset`, which, together with `rangeLength`, allows extensions to use `(offset,length)` coordinates to keep track of text document changes.

### Source Code Action kinds

`CodeActionKind.Source` identifies Code Actions that apply to the entire file. Organize imports is a good example of a `Source` Code Action since it can be triggered from any position in a file.

`Source` Code Actions do not show up in the normal Quick Fix lightbulb menu. They must be explicitly requested using the `editor.action.sourceAction` command. `Source` Code Actions also show up in the new **Source Actions** context menu.

### Organize imports Code Actions

Building on `Source` Code Actions, the newly added `CodeActionKind.SourceOrganizeImports` identifies an organize imports Code Action. These actions can be triggered using `editor.action.organizeImports` and have a standard keyboard shortcut: `kb(editor.action.organizeImports)`.

If your extension already implements organize imports, we highly recommend that you migrate it to use `CodeActionKind.SourceOrganizeImports` so that users have a more consistent experience across languages.

### CodeActionProviderMetadata

`registerCodeActionsProvider` now takes an optional `CodeActionProviderMetadata` argument which lets extensions tell VS Code about the kind of Code Actions that a `CodeActionProvider` will provide. This information is used by VS Code to enable the new **Refactor** and **Source Action** context menus. The **Refactor** context menu, for example, will only be enabled when a `CodeActionProvider` is registered with `CodeActionProviderMetadata` indicating that it that provide will return `refactor.*` Code Actions.

### Webview API

The webview API allows extensions to create fully customizable views within VS Code. For example, the built-in Markdown extension uses webviews to render Markdown previews. Webviews can also be used to build complex user interfaces beyond what VS Code's native APIs support.

![A webview showing a cat gif](images/1_23/webview.png)

A [new extension authoring page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/webview) covers the webview API. You can also find an example webview API extension [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/webview-sample). We look forward to see how extension authors put this powerful new API to use.

### Application scope settings

If you want your settings to be applied at application level and not get overridden at a window or resource level, you can do that now by using `application` scope.

```json
"configuration": {
    "properties": {
        "git.path": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Path to the git executable",
            "scope": "application"
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** Deprecated `isExecutable` property in favor of using `application` scope since it was meant for the same purpose.

## Proposed Extension APIs

This milestone we added several new proposed extension APIs. We plan to add these APIs to stable in a future milestone once we are confident enough with them. We welcome any feedback on how they work for your extension.

> **Note:** These APIs are still proposed, so in order to use it, you must opt into it by adding a `"enableProposedApi": true` to `package.json` and you'll have to copy the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) into your extension project. Also be aware that you cannot publish an extension to the Marketplace that uses the `enableProposedApi` attribute.

### Task API

The task API received further polish around task querying and execution from an extension. The newly supported API is:

* `fetchTasks` takes a filter to only query for a subset of tasks.
* `taskExecutions` support fetching the execution objects for all running tasks.
* `TaskExecution` objects provided via `executeTask`, `taskExecutions` or one of the events can be compared using `===`.

The API is still in the proposed state.

### Protocol Handler API

The Protocol Handler API lets extensions handle system-wide URIs. This functionality is useful for cross-application integrations, since it lets other applications send URIs to specific extensions.

```ts
export interface ProtocolHandler {
  handleUri(uri: Uri): void;
}

export namespace window {

  /**
  * Registers a protocol handler capable of handling system-wide URIs.
  */
  export function registerProtocolHandler(handler: ProtocolHandler): Disposable;
}
```

Here's an example Protocol Handler registration:

```ts
function activate() {
    registerProtocolHandler({
        handleUri(uri: Uri) {
            console.log('Received URI', uri.toString());
        }
    });
}
```

For this API, there is a strict relationship between URI authorities and extensions which will handle them: the URI authority must be the extension's ID (`publisher.name`). Take the following URI, for example:

```
 vscode://vscode.git/clone?repo=foobar
 \____/   \________/ \___/ \_________/
   |           |        |       |
scheme    authority    path   query
```

This URI's authority is `vscode.git`, so VS Code will forward it to the `vscode.git` extension, given that it has properly registered a Protocol Handler.

Since it can happen that URIs are open before extensions are even registered, a new `onUri` activation event was also introduced. This lets your extension be activated whenever a URI directed towards it is opened.

**Note:** URI handling is [not yet supported in Linux](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/48528).

## Contributions to Extensions

Our team maintains or contributes to a number of VS Code extensions. Most notably this month:

### Sublime Text Keymap extension
[The Sublime Text Keymap extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings) is now able to import settings from Sublime.

The first time the extension is launched a prompt is shown that displays all your importable Sublime settings.
If you want to import your settings at a later time use the `Sublime Text Keymap: Import Sublime Text Settings` command from the Command Palette (F1).
![Sublime Settings Importer](images/1_23/SublimeSettingsImporter.gif)


## Engineering

### Improved Smoke Test stability

VS Code has always had a smoke test, which is used to keep quality under strict control. We have automated the smoke test yet failed to make it stable. This milestone we've dedicated a few resources to improving stability and performance of the smoke test. More details can be found in [pull request #47471](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/47471).

## New Documentation

### Website deployment tutorial using Azure Storage

We have a new [Deploy static website to Azure](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/static-website/getting-started?utm_source=VsCode&utm_medium=ReleaseNotes) tutorial for creating and deploying a static website using [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/).
