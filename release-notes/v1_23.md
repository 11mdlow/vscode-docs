# April 2018 (version 1.23)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.23 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/47369)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/66?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the April milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Editor

### Highlighted indent guides

VS Code can now highlight the active indent guide, as you move your cursor between various code blocks. The color name is `editorIndentGuide.activeBackground`:

### Improved editor positioning

In certain cases when changing the editor scroll height (such as resizing a wrapped editor, using mouse wheel zooming, or modifying  a CodeLens), the editor would attempt to maintain the centered line in the viewport. VS Code now maintains the first line in the viewport, providing a more stable editor experience.

### Column selection using middle mouse button

In VS Code, column selection can be added by holding `Shift` and `Alt` and then using the left mouse button. Now the middle mouse button can also be used to create a column selection:

![Editor column selection](images/1_23/editor-column-select.gif)

> Note: When setting `editor.multiCursorModifier` to `ctrlCmd`, the modifiers are `Shift` and `Ctrl` on Windows and `Shift` and `Cmd` on macOS.

### Message when attempting to edit read-only editor

In certain scenarios, such as when diffing the HEAD against the Git index, both left and right diff editors are read-only. When attempting to edit in such cases, a message will be shown to indicate that the editor is read-only:

### Run code actions on save

The new `editor.codeActionsOnSave` setting lets you configure a set of code actions that are run when a file is saved. For example, for JavaScript, TypeScript, and other extensions that contribute an organize imports code action, you can enable organize imports on save by [setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings):

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
     "source.organizeImports": true
}
```

You can also enable or disable which code actions are run on save per language using a [language specific setting]((https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_language-specific-editor-settings). The following settings enable organize imports on save for TypeScript files only:

```json
"[typescript]": {
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.organizeImports": true
    }
},
"[typescriptreact]": {
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.organizeImports": true
    }
}
```

## Workbench

### Improved handling of UTF-16 encoded files

VS Code always supported the UTF-16 encoding for files but required a BOM (byte order mark) to properly detect this encoding. If VS Code didn't find a BOM, the file would not be opened and the user saw an information message.

With this release, we added a new action to this message to open the file as text in the editor:

![Open binary](images/1_23/binary.png)

Once opened, you can then change the encoding to try to decode the text.

In addition, we now have a heuristic that tries to detect UTF-16 without a BOM automatically. This heuristic should work for all UTF-16 files that contain only ASCII characters.

## Languages

### Markdown workspace symbol search

A pull request from [@pradeepmurugesan](https://github.com/pradeepmurugesan) adds markdown support for workspace symbol search. After opening a markdown file for the first time, you can use (`kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)`) to search through the headers of all markdown files in the current workspace:

## Extension Authoring

### Include offset based information in document change events

`TextDocumentContentChangeEvent` has a new property, `rangeOffset`, which, together with `rangeLength`, allows extensions to use `(offset,length)` coordinates to keep track of text document changes.

### Source code action kinds

`CodeActionKind.Source` identifies code actions that apply to the entire file. Organize imports is a good example of a `Source` code action since it can be triggered from any position in a file.

`Source` code actions do not show up in the normal quick fix lightbulb menu. They must be explicitly requested using the `editor.action.sourceAction` command. `Source` code actions also show up in the new 'Source Actions' context menu.

### Organize imports code actions

Building on `Source` code actions, the newly added `CodeActionKind.SourceOrganizeImports` identifies an organize imports code action. These actions can be triggered using `editor.action.organizeImports` and have a standard keyboard shortcut: `kb(editor.action.organizeImports)`.

If your extension already implements organize imports, we highly recommend that you migrate it to use `CodeActionKind.SourceOrganizeImports` so that users have a more consistent experience across languages.

### CodeActionProviderMetadata

`registerCodeActionsProvider` now takes an optional `CodeActionProviderMetadata` argument which lets extensions tell VS Code about the kind of code actions that a `CodeActionProvider` will provide. This information is used by VS Code to enable the new 'Refactor' and 'Source Action' context menus. The refactor context menu for example will only be enabled when a `CodeActionProvider` is registered with `CodeActionProviderMetadata` indicating that it that provide will return `refactor.*` code actions.

### Webview API

The webview API allows extensions to create fully customizable views within Visual Studio Code. For example, the built-in Markdown extension uses webviews to render Markdown previews. Webviews can also be used to build complex user interfaces beyond what VS Code's native APIs support.

![A webview showing a cat gif](images/1_23/webview.png)

A [new extension authoring page](/docs/extensions/webview.md) covers the webview API. You can also find an example webview API extension [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/webview-sample). We look forward to see how extension authors put this powerful new API to use.
