# July 2016 (version 1.4)

TODO

Here are the highlights:

* **Workbench**: TODO.
* **Editor**: TODO.
* **Languages**: TODO.
* **Debugging**: TODO.
* **Extension Authoring**: TODO.

## Workbench

### Item

## Editor

### Snippets and Suggestions

By default VS Code shows snippets and completion proposals in one widget. This is not always desirable such that we added a new configuration setting called `editor.snippetSuggestions`. It controls whether snippets should be shown in the suggest widget (`"none"`) or how snippet proposals should be sorted - `"top"`, `"inline"`, or `"bottom"`. As before the default is `inline`.

In addition, we added a new command to just insert a snippet. It's called _Insert Snippet_ and you can find in the command palette.

### Tab Completion

The editor now supports tab completions. Enable it using the `editor.tabCompletion` setting. Then type the prefix of a snippet and press `Tab` to insert it.

Note that quick suggestions and tab completion might interfere because the suggest widget also reacts on `Tab`. You either disable quick suggestions (`editor.quickSuggestions = false`) or not show snippets in the suggest widget (`editor.snippetSuggestions = "none"`).

### Item

## Languages

### JSON completions
There has been some small improvements for the JSON completions:
- In schema based JSON documents, we offer to complete empty arrays, objects and string if we know the type of a property but the schema doesn't describe any defaults.
- Completion support for the `$schema` property and values

## Debugging

### Variable Paging
Previously large data structures (Array, Buffer, Map, Set) were broken into "chunks" in the debug extension. Now this is done on the VS Code side so all the debug extensions can benefit from this in the future.

### Restart Frame
VS Code now has a 'Restart Frame' action in the stack frame context menu in the CALL STACK viewlet. 'Restart Frame' is only available for debug extensions that support this functionality, e.g. VS Code's builtin Node Debug.

### Node Debuggging

Breakpoints changes on Save -> unverified breakpoints.

### Item

## Extension Authoring

### New added to move away from deprecated __characterPairSupport and __electricCharacterSupport.
The deprecated configuration settings can now both be replaced by the `autoClosingPairs` setting in the language-configuration.json file in your extension. See [#9281](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9281) for detailed instructions.

### Sorting of groups

Last milestone we added support to contribute menu items to different places in the editor. This milestone we have refined sorting of groups. They are now sorted in lexicographical order with the following defaults/rules: The context menu of the editor these default: `navigation`, `1_modification`, and `9_cutcopypase`. Note that the `navigation` group comes first in all cases.

You can add menu items to these groups or add new groups of menu items inbetween, below, or above. Now only the editor context menu allows full control like this but be assured that we will migrate the editor title menu and the explorer context menu soon.

### DocumentLinkProvider API

VS Code has a built in link detector that finds http, https, and file links to make them clickable in the editor. We have added new API that allows extension writers to add custom link detection logic. Implement a `DocumentLinkProvider` and use the [`registerDocumentLinkProvider`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L3814)-function to introduce it to the editor.
