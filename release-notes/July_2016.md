# July 2016 (version 1.4)

During July we have slowed down feature work in favor of reducing our bug backlog and removing debt. However, we were still able to add some improvements. Here are the highlights:

* **Workbench**: TODO.
* **Editor**: TODO.
* **Languages**: TODO.
* **Debugging**: TODO.
* **Extension Authoring**: TODO.

## Editor

### Snippets and Suggestions

By default VS Code shows snippets and completion proposals in one widget. This is not always desirable such that we added a new configuration setting called `editor.snippetSuggestions`. It controls whether snippets should be shown in the suggest widget (`"none"`) or how snippet proposals should be sorted - `"top"`, `"inline"`, or `"bottom"`. As before the default is `inline`.

In addition, we added a new command to just insert a snippet. It's called _Insert Snippet_ and you can find in the command palette.

### Tab Completion

The editor now supports tab completions. Enable it using the `editor.tabCompletion` setting. Then type the prefix of a snippet and press `Tab` to insert it.

Note that quick suggestions and tab completion might interfere because the suggest widget also reacts on `Tab`. You either disable quick suggestions (`editor.quickSuggestions = false`) or not show snippets in the suggest widget (`editor.snippetSuggestions = "none"`).

## Workbench

### Editor Actions

When we added tabs, we put the editor actions into the context menu to gain some space. From the feedback it was clear that this made them much harder to discover. We have changed this behaviour and made them visible in the title header again.

### Drag and Drop

You can now drag and drop tabs across windows. Support to drop a folder into Code to open it has been lost in the last release, but it is now back again.

### Git commit message template

If you have a message template configured in your git, then the Git view in VS Code shows that message in commit message box by default. Thanks to [William Raiford](https://github.com/bill-mybiz) for contributing this feature.

### Integrated Terminal Improvements

The integrated terminal had several changes related to polish and compatibility related improvements this release:

- **IME support**: Input Method Editor (IME) support has been implemented, allowing input of CJK and Indic characters.

  ![IME support in Visual Studio Code](images/July_2016/terminal_ime.png)

- **Copy and paste support on Windows and Linux**: Proper copy and paste support has arrived for Windows and Linux within the terminal. The default keybindings are `kb(workbench.action.terminal.copySelection)` and `kb(workbench.action.terminal.paste)` respectively.
- **Context menu**: A right-click context menu has been added with the options "New Terminal", "Copy" and "Paste".
- **Accessibility**: It's now possible to escape focus in the terminal by pressing `kb(editor.action.toggleTabFocusMode)` to enable tab focus mode, just like in the editor. When this mode is enabled, tab and shift+tab will not be passed to the terminal but instead change the element that is being focused.

## Languages

### JSON completions
There has been some small improvements for the JSON completions:
- In schema based JSON documents, we offer to complete empty arrays, objects and string if we know the type of a property but the schema doesn't describe any defaults.
- Completion support for the `$schema` property and values

## Debugging

### Restart Frame
VS Code now supports to restart the execution of a stack frame. This can be useful in situations where you have found a problem in your code and you want to rerun a small portion of the code with modified input values. Stopping and then restarting the full debug session for this can be very time-consuming. Here the 'Restart Frame' action allows you to re-enter the current function after you have changed some variables with the 'Set Value' action:

![Restart Frame](images/July_2016/restartFrame.gif)

Since 'Restart Frame' won't unroll any state changes it may not always work as expected.

'Restart Frame' is only available if the underlying debug extension supports it.
Initially this is only the case for VS Code's built-in Node Debug.
Make sure to use a node.js version >= 5.11 since earlier versions do not work in all situations.

### Variable Paging
Previously VS Code expected that large data structures like arrays were broken into "chunks" in a debug extension and consequently only a few debug extensions supported this useful feature. With this release we have moved this functionality into the VS Code debugger frontend so that all debug extensions can easily benefit from this in the future.

See section "Debug Protocol Changes" below for details of how a debug extension can make use of this.



## Extension Authoring

### New added to move away from deprecated __characterPairSupport and __electricCharacterSupport.
The deprecated configuration settings can now both be replaced by the `autoClosingPairs` setting in the language-configuration.json file in your extension. See [#9281](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9281) for detailed instructions.

### Editor Commands

- **Move cursor:** We have added a new command that allows you to move the cursor to different logical positions in the editor - [9143](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9143)
```
commands.executeCommand('cursorMove', {to: 'up', by: 'wrappedLine', value: '2'})
```

- **Move active editor:** We have added a new command that allows you to move the active editor across tabs with in the group or across groups - [8234](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8234#issuecomment-234573410)
```
commands.executeCommand('moveActiveEditor', {to: 'left', by: 'tab', value: '3'})
```

### Sorting of groups

Last milestone we added support to contribute menu items to different places in the editor. This milestone we have refined sorting of groups. They are now sorted in lexicographical order with the following defaults/rules: The context menu of the editor these default: `navigation`, `1_modification`, and `9_cutcopypase`. Note that the `navigation` group comes first in all cases.

![Menu Group Sorting](images/July_2016/groupSorting.png)

You can add menu items to these groups or add new groups of menu items inbetween, below, or above. Now only the editor context menu allows full control like this but be assured that we will migrate the editor title menu and the explorer context menu soon.

### DocumentLinkProvider API

VS Code has a built in link detector that finds http, https, and file links to make them clickable in the editor. We have added new API that allows extension writers to add custom link detection logic. Implement a `DocumentLinkProvider` and use the [`registerDocumentLinkProvider`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L3814)-function to introduce it to the editor.

### Debug Extension Authoring: Additions to the Debug Protocol

The [debug protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/master/protocol/src/debugProtocol.ts) has been extended in the following areas (and VS Code already provides the corresponding UI):

* **Restart Frame**: If a debug adapter returns the capability `supportsRestartFrame`, VS Code shows a 'Restart Frame' action in the context menu of the CALL STACK view and calls the new `restartFrame` request upon execution of the 'Restart Frame' action. The `restartFrame` request must result in a `StoppedEvent` so that the UI can be updated for the new location.
* **Variable Paging**: 'variables paging' adds support for paging variables and their children.
The debugger UI in VS Code 1.4 uses this to present variables with many children with a better scalable (paged) UI and fetches the children in a piecemeal way. A debug adapter can find out whether the client supports variable paging by checking the value of
the `supportsVariablePaging` client capability passed as an argument to the `initializeRequest`.<br>
Through the optional attributes `indexedVariables` and `namedVariables` the debug adapter can return both the number of indexed properties (e.g. array slots) and named properties of a variable. These two properties can be returned in all places where a `variablesReference` property is returned, that is in the `Variables` and `Scope` data types and in the `evaluateRequest` response.<br>
Additional optional attributes have been added to the `variablesRequest` to give the VS Code debugger UI better control over what children of a variable to fetch. An attribute `filter` is used to limit the fetched children to either `indexed` or `named` and the attributes `start` and `count` are used to further limit the children to a certain range.
* **Continued Event**: A debug adapter can now optionally send a `ContinueEvent` to the client to indicate that the execution of the debuggee has continued.
* **Source request supports mime type**: A debug adapter can now set a `mimeType` attribute on the `SourceRequest` response which a client can use to find a suitable editor.
* **Variable Type client capability**: A debug adapter can find out whether the client shows the variable's type attribute in the UI by checking the value of
the `supportsVariableType` client capability passed as an argument to the `initializeRequest`.
