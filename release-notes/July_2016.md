# July 2016 (version 1.4)

TODO

Here are the highlights:

* **Workbench**: TODO.
* **Editor**: TODO.
* **Languages**: TODO.
* **Debugging**: TODO.
* **Extension Authoring**: TODO.

## Workbench

### Item

## Editor

### Snippets and Suggestions

By default VS Code shows snippets and completion proposals in one widget. This is not always desirable such that we added a new configuration setting called `editor.snippetSuggestions`. It controls whether snippets should be shown in the suggest widget (`"none"`) or how snippet proposals should be sorted - `"top"`, `"inline"`, or `"bottom"`. As before the default is `inline`.

In addition, we added a new command to just insert a snippet. It's called _Insert Snippet_ and you can find in the command palette.

### Tab Completion

The editor now supports tab completions. Enable it using the `editor.tabCompletion` setting. Then type the prefix of a snippet and press `Tab` to insert it.

Note that quick suggestions and tab completion might interfere because the suggest widget also reacts on `Tab`. You either disable quick suggestions (`editor.quickSuggestions = false`) or not show snippets in the suggest widget (`editor.snippetSuggestions = "none"`).

### Item

## Languages

### JSON completions
There has been some small improvements for the JSON completions:
- In schema based JSON documents, we offer to complete empty arrays, objects and string if we know the type of a property but the schema doesn't describe any defaults.
- Completion support for the `$schema` property and values

## Debugging

### Variable Paging
Previously VS Code expected that large data structures like arrays were broken into "chunks" in a debug extension and consequently only a few debug extensions supported this useful feature. With this release we have moved this functionality into the VS Code debugger frontend so that all debug extensions can easily benefit from this in the future.

See section "Debug Protocol Changes" below for details of how a debug extension can make use of this.

### Restart Frame
VS Code now supports to restart the execution of a stack frame. This can be useful in situations where you have found a problem in your code and you want to rerun a small portion of the code with modified input values. Stopping and then restarting the full debug session for this can be very time-consuming. Here the 'Restart Frame' action allows you to re-enter the current function after you have changed some variables with the 'Set Value' action:

![Restart Frame](images/July_2016/restartFrame.gif)

Since 'Restart Frame' won't unroll any state changes it may not always work as expected.

'Restart Frame' is only available if the underlying debug extension supports it.
Initially this is only the case for VS Code's built-in Node Debug.
Make sure to use a node.js version >= 5.11 since earlier versions do not work in all situations.


## Extension Authoring

### New added to move away from deprecated __characterPairSupport and __electricCharacterSupport.
The deprecated configuration settings can now both be replaced by the `autoClosingPairs` setting in the language-configuration.json file in your extension. See [#9281](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9281) for detailed instructions.

### Sorting of groups

Last milestone we added support to contribute menu items to different places in the editor. This milestone we have refined sorting of groups. They are now sorted in lexicographical order with the following defaults/rules: The context menu of the editor these default: `navigation`, `1_modification`, and `9_cutcopypase`. Note that the `navigation` group comes first in all cases.

You can add menu items to these groups or add new groups of menu items inbetween, below, or above. Now only the editor context menu allows full control like this but be assured that we will migrate the editor title menu and the explorer context menu soon.

### DocumentLinkProvider API

VS Code has a built in link detector that finds http, https, and file links to make them clickable in the editor. We have added new API that allows extension writers to add custom link detection logic. Implement a `DocumentLinkProvider` and use the [`registerDocumentLinkProvider`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L3814)-function to introduce it to the editor.

### Debug Extension Authoring: Additions to the Debug Protocol

The debug protocol has been extended in the following areas (and VS Code already provides the corresponding UI for some of them):

* **Restart Frame**: If a debug adapter returns the [capability `supportsRestartFrame`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/master/protocol/src/debugProtocol.ts#L758), VS Code shows a 'Restart Frame' action in the context menu of the CALL STACK view and calls the new [`restartFrame` request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/master/protocol/src/debugProtocol.ts#L424) upon execution of the 'Restart Frame' action.
