## Workbench

### Hot Exit

### Zen Mode

### Configurable Activity Bar

The Activity Bar is home to all views shipped with VS Code (File Explorer, Search, Debug). Many people use it to quickly switch between views and to see information about a view (for example, the number of outgoing files on the Git view).

In this release, we improved the Activity Bar with several new features. First of all, it is now possible to reorder views using drag and drop. The order is kept and restored between restarts of VS Code. Second, you can now remove entries from the Activity Bar using the context menu on either the Activity Bar itself or the particular view to remove. 

Removed views will still show up in the Activity Bar when opened but their icon will not be displayed when you switch to another view. This is similar to the well known behavior of an application dock where you can pin applications to always show them or unpin them if you want the application icon to be removed once the application quits.

Finally, if the window gets small enough so that all view icons can not show, a new overflow menu was added to show the views in a dropdown:

### View Picker

A new picker is added that shows Views, Panels, Output channels and Terminals and allows for easy opening of those. You can open it via the **Open View** command or by typing `view` followed by a `space` into quick open.

On Windows and Mac, you can press `kbstyle(Ctrl+Q)` to bring up the picker. On Linux, you can reassign the keybinding if you want (`kbstyle(Ctrl+Q)` is assigned to quitting on Linux). Pressing `kbstyle(Ctrl+Q)` and holding the `kbstyle(Ctrl)` key while pressing the `kbstyle(Q)` allows you to jump to an entry from the list and open it after you release the keys.

### Settings Improvements

### Git clone

### Mac: Custom Themed Title

On macOS, we are now drawing our own custom title instead of the native one to allow for the theme color to be picked up. This behavior can be changed with the new `window.titleBarStyle` setting. The new default is `custom` but you can set the value to `native` to go back to the old behavior after a restart.

### Hide the Activity Bar

A new setting `workbench.activityBar.visible` lets you hide the Activity Bar to the side of the view area.

We also added a related entry to the **View** menu as well as in **Command Palette**. The related command has the id `workbench.action.toggleActivityBarVisibility`.

### New Setting to Show Full Path in Window Title

We added a new setting `window.showFullPath` that will show the full path to an opened file in the window title instead of the workspace relative one.

### New Setting to Hide Close Buttons on Tabs

We added a new setting `workbench.editor.showTabCloseButton` that will hide the Close buttons on tabs. Dirty indications are still visible at the same location but you will not accidentally close tabs with the mouse once enabled.

## Editor

### Selection Menu

### New Setting to insert Final Newline into Files

We added a new setting `files.insertFinalNewline` to automatically add a newline at the end of files when saving. 

### Keybinding Commands can now Define Arguments

We added support to invoke commands with arguments to the `keybindings.json` configuration file. The following is an example of this by overriding the Enter key to print some text:

`{ "key": "enter", "command": "type", "args": { "text": "Hello World"}, "when": "editorTextFocus" }`

The type command will receive `{ "text": "Hello World"}` as first argument and add "Hello World" to the file instead of producing the default command.

## Languages

### JavaScript language support in HTML

### Markdown preview improvements

Hide YAML metadata
Preview settings for fontFamily, fontSize, lineHeight

## Extensions

### Item

## Node Debugging

### Item

## Extension Authoring

### VS Code Debug Protocol

Specifying a top level `debugServer` attribute in `launch.json` is no longer supported. This attribute now has to be specified per launch configuration. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13783).

### Breaking Change: TBD

### Item

## Miscellaneous

### Electron Update

In this release, we updated from Electron 1.3.x to 1.4.x. This brings a Chrome update from version 52 to 53. We have heard from users that this update reduces font blurriness on Windows when running with >100% DPI.

Another benefit is that we can now enable the High Contrast theme automatically when we detect that Windows is running in high contrast mode. VS Code will open in high contrast mode when Windows is configured as such and will also switch to high contrast mode if you change the mode in Windows while VS Code is running.

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id

`kb(workbench.action.quickOpenView)`|Quick Open View|`workbench.action.quickOpenView`
`kb(workbench.action.nextEditorInGroup)`|Open Next Editor in Group|`workbench.action.nextEditorInGroup`
