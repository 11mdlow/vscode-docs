## Workbench

### Mac: Custom Themed Title

On macOS we are now drawing our own custom title instead of the native one to allow for the theme color to be picked up. This behaviour can be changed from the newly introduced `window.titleBarStyle` setting. The new default is `custom` and `native` can be set to go back to the old behaviour after a restart.

### Hide the Activity Bar

A newly introduced setting `workbench.activityBar.visible` setting allows to hide the activity bar to the side of the viewlet area.

We also added a related entry to the View menu as well as command palette. The related command has the id `workbench.action.toggleActivityBarVisibility`.

### New Setting to Show Full Path in Window Title

We added a new setting `window.showFullPath` that will show the full path to an opened file in the window title instead of the workspace relative one.

### New Setting to Hide Close Buttons on Tabs

We added a new setting `workbench.editor.showTabCloseButton` that will hide the close buttons on tabs. Dirty indications are still visible at the same location but you will not accidentally close taby with the mouse anymore once enabled.

### Electron Update

In this release we update from Electron 1.3.x to 1.4.x. This brings a Chrome update from version 52 to 53. We have heard from users that this update reduces font blurriness on Windows when running with >100% DPI.

Another benefit is that we can now enable high contrast theme automatically when we detect that Windows runs in high contrast mode. Code will open in high contrast mode when Windows is configured as such and will also switch to high contrast mode if you change the mode in Windows while Code is running 

## Editor

### New Setting to insert Final Newline into Files

We added a new setting `files.insertFinalNewline` to automatically add a newline at the end of files when saving. 

### Keybinding Commands can now Define Arguments

We added support to invoke commands with arguments to the `keybindings.json` configuration file. The following is an example of this by overriding the Enter key to print some text:

`{ "key": "enter", "command": "type", "args": { "text": "Hello World"}, "when": "editorTextFocus" }`

The type command will receive `{ "text": "Hello World"}` as first argument and add "Hello World" to the file instead of producing the default command.
