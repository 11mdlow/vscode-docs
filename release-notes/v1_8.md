## Workbench

### Mac: Custom Themed Title

On macOS we are now drawing our own custom title instead of the native one to allow for the theme color to be picked up. This behaviour can be changed from the newly introduced `window.titleBarStyle` setting. The new default is `custom` and `native` can be set to go back to the old behaviour after a restart.

### New Setting to Show Full Path in Window Title

We added a new setting `window.showFullPath` that will show the full path to an opened file in the window title instead of the workspace relative one.

## Editor

### New Setting to insert Final Newline into Files

We added a new setting `files.insertFinalNewline` to automatically add a newline at the end of files when saving.
