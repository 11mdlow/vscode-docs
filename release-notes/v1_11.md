## Contributions to Extensions

Our team maintains or contributes to a number of VS Code extensions. Most notably:

* [Go](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lukehoban.Go)
* [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint)
* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
* [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker)
* [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome)
* [Mono Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.mono-debug)
* [VSCodeVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)

We also continued the work on our [PHP parser](https://github.com/Microsoft/tolerant-php-parser). We designed it to help extension authors provide better tooling support for PHP. To verify our design and to help the PHP community with concrete first steps, we started to adopt the parser in the [PHP language server](https://github.com/felixfbecker/php-language-server).
