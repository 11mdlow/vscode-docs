### TypeScript 2.2.2
VS Code now ships with TypeScript 2.2.2. This release includes a number of important bug fixes and performance improvements. You can find a complete list of changes [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/milestone/40?closed=1).


### Implementation Code Lens for TypeScript
We now include a code lens that shows the number of implementors of interfaces and abstract classes in TypeScript code.

Clicking on the code lens will display a list of all implementations.

This feature is disabled by default and requires TypeScript 2.2.1+. To enable it, simply add `"typescript.implementationsCodeLens.enabled": true` to your settings.

### Simplified TypeScript Server Log Collection

Added a new `"typescript.tsserver.log"` setting to simplify the collection of logs from the TypeScript server that powers VS Code's TypeScript and JavaScript language support. These logs can be used to debug issues with JS and TS language support, and make it easier for users to provide these logs during issue investigations.

The new logging experinace is supported with TypeScript 2.2.2+. Simply set `"typescript.tsserver.log": "verbose"` and reload VS Code to enable logging to a file. Use the `"TypeScript: Open TS Server log"` command to open the log file in the editor.

### Improved Support for Objective-C++

VS Code now includes a `objective-cpp` language mode for working with Objective-C++. Prevously, `.mm` files were treated as regular C++.

This release also improves syntax coloring of Objective-C++ files.
