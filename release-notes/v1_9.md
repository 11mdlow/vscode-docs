## Workbench

### New entries in the context menu of tabs

Additional entries have been added to the context menu of tabs that show files. You can copy the path of the file or reveal it in the native OS explorer or the explorer in the side bar.

![Tab Context Menu](images/1_9/tab-context.png)

### New setting to control close button in tabs

We added a new setting `workbench.editor.tabCloseButton` that controls if the close button should show on the right (default), left or not be visible at all.

![Tab Close Button on the Left](images/1_9/tabclose.png)

Note: the previous `workbench.editor.showTabCloseButton` was removed in favor of this new option.

### Panels title bar update

The title bar of the horizontal panel is now showing all the other panels that are available and thus makes it much easier to switch between panels.

![Panels](images/1_9/panel.png)

### Control if files/folders should open in a new window or last active

There are many ways how to open files or folders when VS Code is already running and for each we have to make a decision whether they should open in the last active window or a new window. Previously we only had a simple setting `window.openFilesInNewWindow` to control this for files and by default, we would actually decide to open files into new windows, instead of reusing the last active window.

With this release, we want to make this more configurable and also change the default behavior for opening files.

A new setting `window.openFoldersInNewWindow` is provided to configure this behavior for folders and possible values are `default`, `on` and `off`. The existing (previously boolean) setting `window.openFilesInNewWindow` was changed to use these same values. In addition, `window.openFilesInNewWindow` now has the default value of `default` which in many cases will reuse the last active window instead of opening a new one.

If configured to be `default`, we will make the best decision about reusing a window or not based on the context from where the open request was made. Flip this to `on` or `off` to always behave the same. For example, if you feel that picking a file or folder from the **File** menu should open into a new window, set this to `on`.

Note: There can still be cases where this setting is ignored (for example, when using the `-new-window` or `-reuse-window` command line option).

### Control the dimensions of new windows

A new setting `window.newWindowDimensions` allows to control how new windows should open. By default, a new window will open in the center of the screen with small dimensions. If you change this setting to `inherit`, the new window will get the same dimensions as the last active one. Setting it to `maximized` or `fullscreen` will always open new windows either maximized or in fullscreen.

### Control menu visibility (Windows, Linux)

A new setting `window.menuBarVisibility` allows for more fine grained control over the top menu visibility on Windows and Linux. By `default`, the menu will be visible and only hides when entering full screen. You can set it to `toggle` to hide it. In the `toggle` state, the menu will show up when you press the `kbstyle(Alt)` key. If you turn the set the value to `hidden`, the menu will remain hidden, even if you press `kbstyle(Alt)`.

Note: If you configure the menu explicitly to be `visible`, it will also remain visible when you enter the fullscreen mode.

### Easy to close all editors when they are dirty

There are situations where you can easily end up with many dirty editors open (for example, you ran a search and replace operation without saving). Previously, when you wanted to close them all, you were asked to Save or Revert each editor one by one. Now, when you invoke the **Close All Editors** action (`kb(workbench.action.closeAllEditors)`), you will see a combined prompt for all dirty files:

![Close All Prompt](images/1_9/closeall.png)

### Compare editors now supports untitled documents

Previously only files could be compared that exist on disk. With this release you can compare any 2 documents, even if they are untitled.

### Tabs with same labels use much less space now

When you have multiple tabs open that show the same file name from different folders, we used to just show the full (workspace relative) path to those files so that you are able to distinguish one from the other. The downside of this approach is that tabs needs a lot more space:

![Old Tabs](images/1_9/tab_old.png)

With this release, we try to find a segment in the path that is different and then only show this to distinguish the two tabs:

![New Tabs](images/1_9/tab_new.png)

### Rename or move dirty files without confirmation

You can now move or rename dirty files without having to save or revert the changes. Any moved or renamed dirty file will preserve the dirty content and dirty state without any confirmation needed.

### Always hot exit on folders

The `files.hotExit` setting has changed from a simple `true`/`false` setting to accept the following options:

- `"off"`: Disable hot exit (same as the old `false` setting).
- `"onExit"`: Enable hot exit when all VS Code windows are shut down (same as the old `true` setting).
- `"onExitAndWindowClose"`: Same as `"onExit"` but trigger hot exit when any folder window closes, regardless of whether it's the window or not. In order to enable more flexibility, this setting will also *not* restore folder windows when you next launch, `"window.reopenFolders": "all"` can be used to restore all previous windows when this setting is used.

### Output scroll lock

Thanks to an external [PR](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/18768) it is now possible to easily stop output from automatically scrolling.

### Zen mode improvements

To reduce visual clutter zen mode now also hides the workbench tabs. We have also introduced the following options to make it easier to fine tune the zen mode experience: `"zenMode.hideStatusBar"`, `"zenMode.hideTabs"`, `"zenMode.fullScreen"`.

### Terminal improvements

**Performance**

Much of the terminal frontend has been rewritten with performance in mind. In short it should no longer lock up the application when processing large amounts of data and it should process data about 5 times faster.

Before (v1.8.1):

![Terminal performance before](images/1_9/terminal-before.gif)

After (v1.9.0):

![Terminal performance before](images/1_9/terminal-after.gif)

**Windows support**

The library used to communicate with the terminal process on Windows has been upgraded which fixes many of the problems the terminal had on Windows such as arrow keys not functioning and the prompt line going out of sync. A special thanks to [Ryan Prichard](https://github.com/rprichard) for his [winpty](https://github.com/rprichard/winpty) library and for assisting with the upgrade.

**Other**

- **PowerShell on Windows 10**: PowerShell is now the default shell on Windows 10 to better align with the [new OS default](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/11/17/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14971-for-pc/#fwfzEgffOGmVfEXs.97).
- **Right-click copy or paste**: On Windows similar to the cmd.exe feature, right clicking within the terminal will copy if there is a selection or paste if there is no selection. This is enabled by default on Windows and can be configured (on any platform) using the `terminal.integrated.rightClickCopyPaste` setting.
- **Cursor styles**: New line and underline cursor styles have been added to the terminal, these can be configured with the `terminal.integrated.cursorStyle` setting.
- **Wide character support**: Wide characters are now sized to consume exactly 2 character widths
- **Better space utilization**: The terminals within the terminal panel should now fill up as much space as possible

### Launch new instance from Unity/Ubuntu

The standard shortcuts to launch a new instance of an application from the Unity launcher now correctly open a new instance of VS Code (`kbstyle(Win+Shift+<number>)`, `kbstyle(Shift)`+click, middle click).

## Editor

### Format on Paste

We have added a new setting to enable format on paste. Update your settings to include `editor.formatOnPaste: true` and have code formatted on paste. Note that this work with existing formatters that support to format a selection such as the TypeScript formatter or other formatters from the marked place.

### Insert snippets

You can now bind your favorite snippets to keybindings. A sample that encloses a selection with single quotes looks like this:

```json
{
	"key": "cmd+k '",
	"command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
	"args": { "snippet": "'$TM_SELECTED_TEXT'" }
}
```

Instead of defining a snippet with `snippet`, you can also refer to a snippet using the `name`-property, like `{ "name": "mySnippet" }`

### Go To Implementation

The new **Go to Implementation** and **Peek Implementation** commands allow you to quickly jump from an interface to its implementers, or from an abstract method to the method implementations.

### Persistent view options

Using Toggle Word Wrap, Toggle Render Whitespace and Toggle Control Characters will now persist the toggled value to user settings.

### Match Case and Whole Words in multicursor actions

The multicursor actions always changed their behaviour based on the toggle values for "Match Case" and "Whole Words". However, this was not really obvious, especially when the find widget is hidden. To make this more clear, triggering the following actions will now either highlight the toggles when the find widget is visible, or briefly show the two options in the top right corner of the editor. Here are the multicursor actions:

| Label | Default Keybinding |
|---|---|
| Add Selection To Next Find Match | `kb(editor.action.addSelectionTonextFindMatch)` |
| Move Last Selection To Next Find Match | `kb(editor.action.moveSelectionTonextFindMatch)` |
| Add Selection To Previous Find Match | `kb(editor.action.addSelectionToPreviousFindMatch)` |
| Move Last Selection To Previous Find Match | `kb(editor.action.moveSelectionToPreviousFindMatch)` |
| Select All Occurrences of Find Match | `kb(editor.action.selectAllMatches)` |
| Change All Occurrences | `kb(editor.action.changeAll)` |

Moreover, the two options will briefly show in the top right corner of the editor also when toggling their value via Toggle Find case sensitive (`kb(toggleFindCaseSensitive)`) or Toggle Find whole word (`kb(toggleFindWholeWord)`)

### Find widget, \n and CRLF files

The semantics of `\n` in the find widget search string, when in regex mode, has now changed to always match the End-Of-Line sequence.

Whereas before, `\n` would always match the `\n` character, `\n` will now match the `\n` characters in files with `\n` line terminators (indicated in the status bar with LF) and will match the `\r\n` sequence in files with `\r\n` line terminators (indicated in the status bar with CRLF).

## Languages

### TypeScript 2.1.5

VS Code now includes TypeScript 2.1.5. This release includes a number of important [bug fixes](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22TypeScript+2.1.5%22+label%3A%22fixed%22+).

### TypeScript References Code Lens

The TypeScript references code lens displays an inline count of reference for classes, interfaces, methods, properties, and exported objects:

![TypeScript references code lens](images/1_9/ts-references-code-lens.png)

You can enable the TypeScript references code lens by setting `"typescript.referencesCodeLens.enabled": true`.

Click on the reference count to quickly browse a list of references:

![TypeScript references code lens peek](images/1_9/ts-references-code-lens-peek.png)

### Support for Suggestions and Formatting in Unsaved JavaScript and TypeScript Files

Normal suggestion and formatting are now enabled for unsaved JavaScript and TypeScript files when using TypeScript 2.1.5+. Previously the file had to be saved to disk to enable these features.

### Icons For TypeScript File and Folder Completions

TypeScript file and folder completion items are now displayed using the corresponding file and folder icons.

![TypeScript file and folder completions](images/1_9/ts-file-and-folder-completion-icons.png)

### Markdown Preview and Editor Integration

VS Code can now synchronize the view of a Markdown editor and its preview. By default, the Markdown preview will automatically scroll to reveal the element at the selected line in the editor.

![Markdown Preview editor selection scroll sync](images/1_9/markdown-selection-preview-scroll-sync.gif)

Also, when the Markdown preview is scrolled, the editor will scroll along with it:

![Markdown Preview to editor scroll sync](images/1_9/markdown-selection-preview-scroll-sync.gif)

Additionally, you can now double click an element in the Markdown preview to automatically open the editor at that line:

![Markdown Preview double click switches to editor](images/1_9/markdown-double-click-preview-switch.gif)

**Other Markdown Improvements**

* Syntax highlighting for C++, Go, Rust, and Scala code blocks in markdown files.
* Fixed Markdown syntax highlighting for block elements on a line immediately after a paragraph.
* When the Markdown preview is first opened, it will automatically scroll to the selected line in the editor.
* A gray bar in the left margin of the Markdown preview indicates the currently selected line.
* Links to local files now work in the Markdown preview.
* In the Markdown editor, you can ctrl click on links to local files to open them in the editor.

### Load Emmet preferences, profiles, snippets and abbreviations from external files

The new setting `emmet.extensionsPath` can be used to provide a location (absolute path) where any or all of `snippets.json`, `syntaxProfiles.json` and `preferences.json` reside. Read more about how to customize Emmet abbreviations at [Emmet Customization](http://docs.emmet.io/customization/).

The existing settings `emmet.preferences` and `emmet.syntaxProfiles` will override the values from the above json files.

Note: The file contents are cached. Therefore, you will need to reload the Visual Studio Code window for the changes in the json files to be reflected.

## Debugging

### debug single files
todo@isi

### Inline variable values in source
Thanks to a user [PR](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/16129) we are now showing inline variable values in source while debugging.
This feature is still in the experimental state, to enable it set `"debug.inlineValues": true` in your settings.

![debug inline values](images/1_9/inline_values.png)

### User level launch.json
As per [user request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18401) it is now possible to have "launch" object in your user settings that will shared across all the workspaces as a launch configuration.

### Copy callstack action
Added a context menu action to the callstack view that copies the callstack to the clipboard. This can be very handy when you need to report a callstack with an issue.

### Add launch configuration from dropdown
It is now possible to add a new launch configuration by simply choosing that option in the debug dropdown.

![add launch configuration](images/1_9/add_launch.png)

## Node Debugging

### Launch configuration snippets for Node.js scenarios
We've added a few launch configuration snippets to support some commonly used Node.js debugging scenarios.
These snippets can be used through IntelliSense when editing the `launch.json`:

![Launch configuration snippets for node.js](images/1_9/launch-snippets.png)


Here is the list of all snippets:

- **Launch Program**: Launch a node.js program in debug mode. The snippet asks you to enter the name of the program file.
- **Launch via NPM**: Launch a node program through an npm 'debug' script. If you have defined an npm debug script in your package.json, you can use this directly from your launch configuration. Make sure that the debug port used in the npm script, corresponds to the port specified in the snippet.
- **Attach to Port**: Attach to the debug port of a running Node.js program. Make sure that the Node.js program to debug has been started in debug mode and the debug port used is the same as theone specified in the snippet.
- **Attach to Process**: Open the process picker to select a node or gulp process for debugging. With this launch configuration you can even attach to a node or gulp process that was not started in debug mode.
- **Nodemon Setup**: Use nodemon to relaunch a debug session automatically whenever the JavaScript source has changed. Make sure that you have nodemon installed globally. Please note that terminating the debug session only terminates the program to debug, not nodemon itself. To terminate nodemon, press Control-C in the integrated terminal.
- **Mocha Tests**: Debug mocha tests in a `test` folder of your project. Make sure that your project has 'mocha' installed in its node_modules folder.
- **Yeoman generator**: Debug a yeoman generator. The snippet asks you to specify the name of the generator. Make sure that your project has 'yo' installed in its node_modules folder and that your generated project has been installed for debugging by running `npm link` in the project folder.
- **Gulp task**: Debug a gulp task. The snippet asks you to specify the name of the gulp task. Make sure that your project has 'gulp' installed in its node_modules folder.

### Just my Code Improvements
- Support node core modules
- Introduce 'deemphasize' style of Source objects in CALL STACK view
- extension based implementation (node2)
Andre & Rob
note from isidor: I have already added that we expose debug/callstack/context contribution in our extension-points.md doc. Though this new contribution point can also be mentioned here in one sentence

### Support 'restart' option for 'launch' requests

### Source maps enabled by default
Andre

## Extension Authoring

### Editor API to insert a snippet

There is a new `TextEditor#edit` overload that allows you to insert a `StringString` into an editor.

### Updating Code Lenses

A `CodeLensProvider` can now have a `onDidChangeCodeLenses`-event which signals to the editor that lenses have changed and need to be refreshed.

### Completion item commit characters

`CompletionItems` can now have a list of commit characters. When a commit character is typed and while a completion is selected, the completion will be inserted as the character is being typed.

### Added new Implementation Provider API

A new `ImplementationProvider` interface was added to support the new **Go to Implementation** feature. A `ImplementationProvider` maps a location in a text document to a list of implementations locations, for example going from an interface to classes that implement this interface or from an abstract method to a list of implementing methods.

Extensions that wish to support **Go to Implementation** can implement `ImplementationProvider` and register the provider using `vscode.languages.registerImplementationProvider`

### New API to open an untitled file with optional language

A new overload was added to the `openTextDocument` method that allows to open an untitled document with optional language. For example you can call:

`openTextDocument({ language: 'xml' })`

To create a text document with XML as language. If you leave out the language options, it will just create a text document with plain text language.

### `TextEditorRevealType.AtTop`

A new `AtTop` value was added to the `TextEditorRevealType` enum. This reveals the range at the top of the viewport.

### `CompletionItemKind.Folder`

A new `Folder` value was added to the `CompletionItemKind` enum.

### Debugger Extension Authoring
