## Workbench

### Easy to close all editors when they are dirty

There are situations where you can easily end up with many dirty editors open (e.g. run a search and replace operation without saving). Previously, when you wanted to close them all you got asked to Save or Revert each and every editor one by one. Now, when you invoke the Close All Editors action (`kb(workbench.action.closeAllEditors)`), you will see a combined prompt for all dirty files opened:

![Close All Prompt](images/1_9/closeall.png)

### Compare editors now supports untitled documents

Previously only files could be compared that exist on disk. With this release you can compare any 2 documents, even if they are untitled.

### Tabs with same labels use much less space now

When you have multiple tabs open that show the same file name from different folders, we used to just show the full (workspace relative) path to those files so that you are able to distinugish one from the other. The downside of this approach is that tabs needs a lot more space:

![Old Tabs](images/1_9/tab_old.png)

With this release we try to find a segment in the path that is different and then only show this to distinugish the two tabs:

### Rename or move dirty files without confirmation

In this release you can now move or rename dirty files without having to save or revert the changes. Any moved or renamed dirty file will preserve the dirty content and dirty state without any confirmation needed.

### New setting to control menu visibility (Windows, Linux)

A new setting `window.menuBarVisibility` allows for more fine grained control over the menu visibility. By default the menu will be `visible` but you can set it to `toggle` to hide it. In this state the menu will still show up when you press the `kbstyle(Alt)` key. Finally, when you turn the setting into `hidden`, the menu will remain hidden, even if you press `kbstyle(Alt)`. 

Note: If you configure the menu explicitly to be `visible`, it will also remain visible when you enter the fullscreen mode.
