# Announcing Intro Videos

August 2, 2016 by Wade Anderson, [@waderyan_](https://twitter.com/waderyan_)

On the product team, we're constantly trying to make VS Code better for you. We spend hours in interviews, usability studies, and interacting with you online. 

A theme that has constintely come up with new users (especially users new to coding) is the need to improve the first experience. Initially, this was hard for us to understand. We use VS Code for our development everyday and don't empathize well with the newest users. 

Today, we're announcing a set of introductory videos. These videos are meant to be the most basic introduction to downloading, installing, and using IntelliSense, debugging, version control and more. 

## Take a Look

Navigate to [Intro Videos - Overview](/docs/introvideos/overview) to get started. Below is the first video covering download, install, and the basics of VS Code. See the full outline and additional learning resources [here](/docs/introvideos/basics).
