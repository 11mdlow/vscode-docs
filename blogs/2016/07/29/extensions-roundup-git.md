# Extensions Roundup - Fun with Git

July 29, 2016 by Wade Anderson, [@waderyan_](https://twitter.com/waderyan_)

The first extension I built for VS Code is called [Git Blame](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waderyan.gitblame). I like the functionality of quickly seeing the blame for the currently selected line. It was simple and effective. Since I built this extension, there has been a plethora of other awesome Git extensions. Here are some of my favorite. 

> Tip: Install any of these extensions by clicking the Extension activity bar button, typing the name of the extension, and clicking install. See more instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_browse-and-install-extensions-in-vs-code). 

## [Annotator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryu1kn.annotator)

Publisher - [Ryuichi Inagaki](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Ryuichi%20Inagaki%22&target=VSCode)

This extension takes blame information to the next level. You can see all the blame information in the gutter and its clickable! When you click on the blame you see the diff of that commit. The gutter color is darker for older commits and lighter for the most recent commits, which was a smooth way to create the UI. Truly an excellent extension and my personal favorite.

## [Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory)

Publisher - [Don Jayamanne](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Don%20Jayamanne%22&target=VSCode)

Don Jayamanne has created some of the most popular extensions in the Marketplace (see the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python)) and he has built a great extension here. With this extension, you will find a very rich feature set for your Git workflow. 
- View history of file or line. 
- Compare a previous copy of a file against the local workspace version. 
- View the changes to the active line

## [Share Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RolandGreim.sharecode)

Publisher - [Roland Greim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Roland%20Greim%22&target=VSCode)

Ever wanted to send your code to Pastebin or a GithubGist? Open the file you want to share and share it with a couple commands in the Command Pallete.

## [Open in Github](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ziyasal.vscode-open-in-github)

Publisher - [ziyasal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22ziyasal%22&target=VSCode)

One of the most popular extensions for the VS Code team. This extension allows you to open the current line in Github.

## [Git Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipecaputo.git-project-manager)

Publisher - [Felipe Caputo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Felipe%20Caputo%22&target=VSCode)

Have other Git projects you want to open quickly with VS Code? Install this extension and quickly bounce around between projects.

## [Partial Diff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryu1kn.partial-diff)

Publisher - [Ryuichi Inagaki](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Ryuichi%20Inagaki%22&target=VSCode)

Ryuichi's second time on this list (quite the publisher)! This extension isn't git specific but it gives you a cool diff functionality I have found useful multiple times while coding my projects.

## [Gitignore](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=michelemelluso.gitignore)

Publisher - [michelemelluso](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22michelemelluso%22&target=VSCode)

This is the first of two gitignore extensions. The READMEs are not detailed, but that's because the functionality needs little introduction. With this gitignore extension right click and add a file to your `.gitignore` in a flash!

![gitignore right click extension](2016_07_29_gitignore-rightclick.png)

## [Gitignore](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codezombiech.gitignore)

Publisher - [CodeZombie](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22CodeZombie%22&target=VSCode)

The second gitignore extension (note from different publishers) will pull in template .gitignore files. Are you coding in Python and want all the "normal" .gitignore specifications? Install this extension and run a simple comand to pull down the .gitignore from [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
