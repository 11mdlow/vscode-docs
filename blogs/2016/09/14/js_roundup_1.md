# Essential JavaScript Extensions

September 14, 2016 by Wade Anderson, [@waderyan_](https://twitter.com/waderyan_)

> This is part one of a three-part series on JavaScript extensions. 

I learned JavaScript during an internship in the summer of 2013. Although not a difficult language to learn, JavaScript didn't come easy. I used a lightweight editor with the rest of my team and missed the deep language integration features from Visual Studio (C#) and Eclipse (Java). Visual Studio Code is not an IDE, but you can extend it to do many of the things an IDE can do. Even with extensions, VS Code is performant, meaning it won't slow down with new extensions (read [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/our-approach#_stability-extension-isolation) about how maintain high performance as extensions are added). The following are some of the essential JavaScript extensions I, and many of you, are using everyday. 

> Tip: Install any of these extensions by clicking the Extensions View button, typing the name of the extension in the Search box, and clicking **Install**. See more instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_browse-and-install-extensions-in-vs-code).
