# Insiders to Alpha

May 16, 2016 by Wade Anderson, [@waderyan_](https://twitter.com/waderyan_)

## Hello Alpha, Goodbye Insiders

Over five thousand developers have been using our Visual Studio Code [Insiders Builds](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/02/01/introducing_insiders_build). With the Insiders build, you were able to use new features and test bug fixes early, providing us with valuable feedback and usage insights prior to each Stable release. Thank you for your help!

## Retiring Insiders - Wait, Why?

Even with access to weekly Insiders builds, many of you asked [TODO link to GH issue] to get access to our VS Code nightly builds. After considering different options, we decided to make our Alpha builds public. We use these builds ourselves internally to develop and test VS Code. As a pilot, we made the Alpha builds available to several community members and given that their reaction was so positive, we decided to retire Insiders. You might ask, "Why not have both Insiders and Alpha?" We want to spend our time making VS Code the best product possible and maintaining separate builds would take too much away from product development.

## Alpha - Fresh out of the Oven

With the Alpha builds, you now have access to the very latest bits we use internally. Once an issue is resolved, you can try it out the very next day and donâ€™t have to wait until the end of the month. We realize that using the newest bits carries some risk but since we use the Alpha builds ourselves, if there are any significant issues, we see and fix them right away. And because Alpha installs side by side with the monthly Stable release, you can always switch to the Stable editor if you are temporarily blocked.

## What's New in each Alpha Build

The "Release Notes" for Alpha builds are the completed issues for the last day, which is obtained by this dynamic query [TODO Insert query for latest completed issues]. You can also see the features being worked on in the iteration plan [TODO Insert query for latest iteration plan]. Keep your feature requests coming! We're listening.

## Goodbye Insiders, Hello Alpha

If you are on the Insiders build, we encourage you to move to Alpha [TODO insert link to Alpha build]. The Insiders builds will no longer be maintained and updated and will quickly be out of date. The last Insiders build will remind you to switch to the nightly build.
