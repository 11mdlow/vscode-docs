# Great Looking Editor Roundup

June 20, 2017 Wade Anderson, [@waderyan_](https://twitter.com/waderyan_)

Having a great looking editor is a necessity for any full time developer. We look at our code a lot. Let's keep things interesting! 

You have a lot of customization in VS Code to change the look of your environment. In this blog we're going to look at color themes, file icon themes, and other settings to change the look and feel of your code editor. 

## Color Themes

The central customization is the ability to change a color theme. A color theme is a set of colors for the editor background, text, language syntax, etc. VS Code comes with a few built in themes, and hundreds you can install in the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3A%22color%20theme%22&target=VSCode&category=Themes&sortBy=Downloads).

Other favorite teams around the VS Code team are Sapphire, Nord and Ayu, shown below.

## File Icon Themes

File icon themes shipped with last August with VS Code 1.5.

Just as with color themes, there are many popular file icon themes to choose from.

## Font Ligatures

There are many settings you can tweak to make VS Code look good. One of my favorites is font ligatures. Enable font ligatures by setting `"editor.fontLigatures"` to `true`. You will need to also have a font installed that supports font liagures. [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is a popular font on the VS Code Team.
