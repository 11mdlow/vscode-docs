# Sublime Text 

April 10, 2017 Wade Anderson, [@waderyan_](https://twitter.com/waderyan_)

I'm a big fan of Sublime Text. It was my [go to editor](TODO Utah JS talk) for my early years of development. 

Naturally, I like VS Code more now :) But sometimes I find I miss things from Sublime Text. I wrote an [extension](TODO link to Sublime Text keymap) a couple months ago to help alleviate some pains I felt. 

There are still more work to do (see this [Github issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3776)), but the gaps are closing fast. You can install extensions to see almost all of the features you are missing. 

If you are coming from Sublime Text, here are a couple extensions I recommend. 

## Sublime Text Keymap 

Marketplace - [Sublime Text Keymap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings)

Author - [Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Microsoft%22&target=VSCode)

As I've written about before, this extension ports the most popular keyboard shortcuts from Sublime Text to VS Code. Its not easy to map the command vernacular from one product to another, which is why I did it for you :)

## Expand Selection To Scope

Marketplace - [Expand Selection To Scope](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vittorioromeo.expand-selection-to-scope)

Author - [Vittorio Romeo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Vittorio%20Romeo%22&target=VSCode)

VS Code has support in this area, but this extension nails a nice sweet spot. Expand your selection to the scope incrementally, including for multiple cursors.

## Sublime Commands

Marketplace - [Sublime Commands](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zarel.sublime-commands)

Author - [Zarel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Zarel%22&target=VSCode)

Ports the transpose, expand selection to line, and split into lines to VS Code.

## Close HTML / XML Tag

Marketplace - [Close HTML / XML tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Compulim.compulim-vscode-closetag)

Author - [Compulim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Compulim%22&target=VSCode)

Adds a keyboard shortcut to add the closing tag for XML and HTML.
