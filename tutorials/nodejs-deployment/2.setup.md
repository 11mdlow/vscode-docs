# Setup

In this step you will install the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI). You will use the CLI to do the following:

* Create an Azure Website
* Create a NoSQL MongoDB database using Azure DocumentDB
* Set up deployment pipeline between the local/remote repository and the Website
* View your application's logs (e.g. `console.log()` output)

## Install the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is cross platform and runs on Windows, MacOS, as well as many different Linux distributions.

> [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

### Log In

Once installed, you can use the `az` command from your favorite terminal. 

Following the instructions, browse to [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) and paste in the 9 character code. When prompted, use the email address and password you used when creating your Azure account.

``` bash
az login
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the code BF9BUDLGR to authenticate.
```

### Update the CLI

Make sure you've got the latest CLI components installed by telling the CLI to update itself. This is useful if you have not run the CLI in a while.

``` bash
az component update
```

### Set the Subscription

If you have multiple Azure subscriptions you will want to make sure you are using the appropriate one for this walkthrough. List all of the subscriptions you have access to and then set the active one.

``` bash
az account list -o table
Name                                         CloudName    SubscriptionId                        State    IsDefault
-------------------------------------------  -----------  ------------------------------------  -------  -----------
Windows Azure MSDN - Visual Studio Ultimate  AzureCloud   b9f03513-e38b-4ef7-81a2-2669c52cdd51  Enabled
Demo App Subscription                        AzureCloud   065849c9-c0c8-43d0-874c-01c7b295a1bc  Enabled  True
ToDo App Subscription                        AzureCloud   546ac631-883f-4fb4-bff0-b8639ed6e7c8  Enabled

az account set --subscription "Windows Azure MSDN - Visual Studio Ultimate"
az configure --defaults location=westus
```

## Prerequisite Check

Before we continue, ensure that you have all of the prerequisites properly installed. Type each command and ensure it displays the version you have installed. If your Node.js version is less than 6, please [upgrade](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to the most current LTS ("Long Term Stable") release.

``` bash
node -v
6.10.2
```

Now check that you have `git` installed. If not, [install](https://git-scm.com/downloads) it and test again.

``` bash
git --version
git version 2.6.4
```
