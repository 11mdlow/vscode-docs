# Code

The first thing we'll need to do is get our source code into a GitHub repository. Browse to your GitHub account and [create a new public repository](https://github.com/new).

We are going to follow the instructions provided by GitHub to create a new repository on the command line, but with a few changes. 
It is a good practice to include a `.gitignore` file in your repository that excludes the `node_modules` folder. We'll do this instead of creating a `README.md` file and we'll add and commit all of the files in the workspace (except `node_modules` of course): 

```bash
echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/**YourGitHubAccount**/myExpressApp.git
git push -u origin master
```
