# Customize Visual Studio Code
You can configure VS Code to work the way you like to work.  Here is a quick primer on some of the most common ways to configure VS Code.
* Configuring [User and Workspace settings](/docs/customization/userandworkspace.md)
* Customize [Key Bindings](/docs/customization/keybindings.md)
* [User Defined Snippets](/docs/customization/userdefinedsnippets.md)

You can also import pre-made customizations to VS Code:
* Adding additional [Themes](/docs/customization/themes.md)
* Adding additional language [Colorizers and Bracket Matchers](/docs/customization/colorizer.md)
 
In addition to the customization described here, you can integrate VS Code into your workflow with [tasks](/docs/editor/tasks.md).
