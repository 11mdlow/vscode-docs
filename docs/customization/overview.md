# Customize Visual Studio Code
You can configure VS Code to work the way you like to work.  Here is a quick primer on some of the most common ways to configure VS Code.
* [User defined Snippets](snippets.md)
* Customize [key bindings](keybindings.md)
* Configuring [User and Workspace settings](userandworkspace.md)

You can also import pre-made customizations to VS Code:
* Adding additional [Themes](themes.md)
* Adding additional language [Colorizers and Bracket Matchers](colorizer.md)
 
In addition to the customization described here, you can integrate VS Code into your workflow with [tasks](tasks.md) or create your own user-defined [snippets](userdefinedsnippets.md).
