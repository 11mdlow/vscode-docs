# Debugging Recipes

Visual Studio Code supports debugging of many languages and platforms via debuggers who either are built-in or  contributed by extensions.

To make it easier to get started with debugging we have made a collection of "debugging recipes" which each contains the steps you need to setup debugging for your favorite platform.

## Chrome - Debug JavaScript in Google Chrome

The Visual Studio Code editor supports debugging of JavaScript running in [Google Chrome](https://electron.atom.io) apps via the [Debugger for Chrome extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome).
