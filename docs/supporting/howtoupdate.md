# How to update to the lastest release

The following shows you how to update to the latest release of Visual Studio Code.

>**Note:** For Mac and Windows users, we have enabled the auto-update channel. If you're prompted by VS Code, accept the newest update and it will get installed (you won't need to do anything else to get the latest bits).

Auto-updates are not supported for Linux.

## Updating on Linux
* Download the VS Code zip file: [64-bit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534108) or [32-bit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=615206).
* Open the zip and run **Code**

## Updating on OS X
You need to do this only if auto-update did not complete.

* Download the VS Code zip file from [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534106).
* Open the zip file and drag **Code** over to **Applications**.
* Launch **Code**.

## Updating on Windows

You need to do this only if auto-update did not complete.

**Important:** Close any running instances of VS Code before attempting to update (to avoid VS Code not being able to start after you update).

* Run the installer from [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534107).
* If you have trouble with the Windows installer, download the VS Code zip file from [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=615207).
