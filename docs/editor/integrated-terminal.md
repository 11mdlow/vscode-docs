# Integrated Terminal

It can be convenient to have a terminal embedded directly in VS Code, initially scoped to the workspace you are working in. You don't have to switch windows or alter the state of an existing terminal for a quick task.

You can open the terminal using `kb(workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal)`, from the **View** | **Toggle Integrated Terminal** menu, or from the **View** > **Toggle Integrated Terminal** command in the **Command Palette**.

## Configuration

The shell used defaults to `$SHELL` on Linux and OS X, and `%COMSPEC%` on Windows. These can be overridden manually by setting `terminal.integrated.shell.*` in [settings](/docs/customization/userandworkspace.md).
