## Editing

In order to edit the VS Code documentation, ensure that you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

Clone a copy of the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs.git
```

VS Code itself is great for reviewing and editing [Markdown](http://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown) with nice preview support.

If you want to use VS Code, simply navigate to the `vscode-docs` directory and launch VS Code from there:

```
cd vscode-docs
code .
```
You can now open any of the Markdown files and easily toggle between preview with the `Open Preview` button in the upper right of the editor.
